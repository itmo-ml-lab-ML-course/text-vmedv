The screen is completely black, I can see the pointer initially.
Since it's a PinePhone it has touchscreen so pointer normally it

If I try to launch a terminal with a physical keyboard nothing happens.
Shortcut to exit works.

### How to reproduce

Just launch it.

727,Moving window to special workspace doesn't allow the cursor to interact with regular windows.,"

When I upgraded Hyprland, I was noticing that moving windows to the special workspace wouldn't allow me to use windows that are on the regular workspace! Please fix this, it really breaks my (and probably many others') workflow!

### How to reproduce

Make sure you are using the version of Hyprland specified, and then just move a window to the special workspace, and try to interact with the window on the regular workspace:

My Case:

Opening up youtube.com in Brave, then opening the video in picture-in-picture (on special workspace), then trying to open a new Brave tab. (I cannot click the new tab button anymore)!

I have the [ThinkPad Basic Dock (40AG0090US)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079NLGTVW/) (and a ThinkPad P14s Gen 1) which provides DisplayPort (Passive) over USB-C and/or a proprietary connector.

This does not happen if the laptop is connected to HDMI directly.

When the laptop is asleep, I sometimes connect it to the dock and then wake it up from sleep. Every time I do this, Hyprland crashes.

### How to reproduce

1. Run `systemctl hibernate`.
2. Connect monitor (details above).
3. Wake up laptop.
4. Observe getting kicked to TTY.

When i tabbing between workspaces, my wallpaper is flashing (happened on both swaybg and hyprpaper). I dont really know is it related to my gpu or hardware but here it is: intel hd 4000 (mesa driver). I watched wiki for some dispatchers for that and stuff, but maybe cuz im blind not finded any, same with already opened issues.

### How to reproduce

Just open some fullscreen,0 window and try to tab between it and other non fullscreen apps, it will flash your wallpaper in that case. For tabbing i was using that allow_workspace_cycles and workspace,previous bind. Hope i described this issue normally, doing it first time :D (animations is turned off)

EDIT: happens on both fullscreen 0 and fullscreen 1 (and on every fullscreen app)

305,Thunderbird only fully initializes when window visible,"

When starting Thunderbird using `exec-once = [workspace 3 silent] thunderbird` it does start and create a new workspace. But I never receive notifications like for mail and calendar. As soon as I switch to its workspace it looks like it just started and starts syncing mail and calendar and I get all the notifications at once. This does not happen when omitting the `silent`. So I am assuming that Thunderbird only starts actually working as soon as it got visible/focus at least once after start.

### How to reproduce

`hyprctl dispatch exec '[workspace 3 silent] thunderbird' ` will produce the issue. 
When using `hyprctl dispatch exec '[workspace 3] thunderbird' ` it does not produce the issue.

675,PREFIX value doesn't seem to propagate well enough when packaging,"

Built Hyprland for Debian Testing (for own use only) with PREFIX=/usr and a local DESTDIR for packaging, On installed package, hyprpm has similar behaviour to #4082 . In my case, the problem was hyprland.pc still pointing to /usr/local as prefix. Once this was corrected, it worked fine. Somehow cmake believed that prefix was still /usr/local when creating hyprland.pc.

6,Unexpected togglefloating dispatcher behavior,"

`togglefloating` dispatcher, when applied to a floating window on another workspace, will move that window to the current workspace instead of just tiling it on the workspace in which window is currently on. But when `togglefloating` is applied the same way to a tiled window - it become float and stays on the original workspace. Seems like an inconsistent behaviour to me.

### How to reproduce

1) Open tiled window
2) Switch to another workspace
3) `hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:window_address`
4) It become floating and stay on it's workspace as expected
5) `hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:window_address`
6) It become tiled as expected and move to current workspace - unexpected, probably should become tiled on workspace, in which it currently on.

Workaround: `add dispatch movetoworkspacesilent same_workspace_on_which_window_is, address:window_address` when switching to tiled state, but it looks dumb.

I've documented them here: https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-wiki/issues/268

I believe uncommon libraries, especially ones, that do not have native OS packages, should be bundled with the release.
You are already bundling libwlroots, which by the way does have Ubuntu package, but not libdisplay-info, libliftoff, and libliftoff, which do not and are required by libwlroots.

I suggest either to remove the libwlroots from the release and add instruction to the wiki on how to install it (preferred) or bundle any 3rd level dependencies that are not commonly found in native OS package repositories.

67,Screen sharing doesn't work on external monitor,"

I don't know if this is an issue with hyprland or maybe with another component like wireplumber or pipewire, but I'll start here.
Window sharing does work on all screens. Screen sharing does also work with both my virtual(headless) screen, and with my laptops internal screen. But it does not work with my external monitor(thunderbolt > lenovo dock > DisplayPort > DELL P3221D). I don't necessarily think that the issue is with how I connect the monitor, because I've had the exact same issue with my old laptop where I was connecting the same monitor using usb-C directly.

I really don't know what's so special about that monitor, but I've attached some info that might help.

### How to reproduce

- start screenshare (e.g. using https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html )
- select external screen
- it starts from the perspective of the app, but the wireblumber log shows an error and the app doesn't receive any video.

807,cursor_inactive_timeout requires moving cursor to activate,"

Marked as bug as I am fairly new on Hyprland so I don't know if it is regression, please feel free to change.
With ```cursor_inactive_timeout = 3``` set, cursor is hiding as expected but when spawning new application (terminal or firefox for example), if the hidden cursor happens to be on top of newly spawned window, cursor is shown and *does not* hide again unless moved. Even slight move triggers normal behavior, if left intact it won't hide at all.
Desired behavior: If already hidden, cursor should stay hidden regardless of if it covers newly spawned window or not.

### How to reproduce

1. Set cursor_inactive_timeout to any few seconds value
2. Wait cursor to hide
3. Using keyboard bind, spawn firefox or terminal (happens with all applications for me)
    - see cursor reappearing since first application covers most of the screen
4. Move cursor around, wait to hide, spawn few more applications.
    - if the (hidden) cursor coordinates fall within boundaries of newly spawned window, it will reappear and won't hide before mouse moves cursor, even slightly.
    - if the (hidden) cursor doesn't cover newly spawned window, it will stay hidden and behave properly.

412,0.25.0 -> broken hover scroll over workspace list in waybar-hyprland,"eproduce
1. Use waybar-hyprland with workspace list.
2. Hover mouse over workspace list.
3. Use scroll.

Expected outcome:
1. Each scroll step result in workspace switch.

Noted outcome:
1. List reacts only for one scroll step
2. Mouse cursor move resets that behavior (another step can be given on input).
3. If workspace is empty you can scroll freely.

I think that's because whenever you switch workspace window is focused (out of waybar). Happens since 0.25.0 release.

I personally would not want it to join a group anyway, just default to the movewindow behaviour, i think its a good idea to have  be consistent in such choices.

Theres probably a reason that its not now that I think about it but just thought such an edge case should be documented as I found no relevant issue.

### How to reproduce

1. Use empty/default Hyprland config.
2. Press `SUPER+Q` (run kitty).
3. Run from kitty's prompt: `hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace`.
4. Press `SUPER+Q` (run another kitty instance in the special workspace).
5. Switch around workspaces with `SUPER+1`, `SUPER+2`, `SUPER+1`.

Kitty's window in the special workspace should retain its focus when switching workspaces, but it doesn't.

1389,Hyprland crashes when disconnecting HDMI monitor,"

Hyprland will work fine when connecting my laptop to an HDMI screen, but when I disconnect it Hyprland will crash with `SIGABRT`. Originally assuming maybe its because my monitor configuration was weird (i was attempting to mirror an HDMI screen onto internal, and wondered if maybe Hyprland was crashing because it lost a display).

This was my hyprland.conf when this issue was happening. It would work perfectly fine when connecting, but it would crash on a disconnect.
```
monitor=HDMI-A-1,3840x2160,0x0,2
monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080,0x0,1,mirror,HDMI-A-1
```

 I set out to use https://github.com/coffebar/hyprland-monitor-attached to get around the issue by dynamically using `hyprctl keyword monitor ...` to reconfigure my monitors on the fly as necessary.

hyprland.conf
```
monitor=eDP-1,highres,auto,1

exec-once = /usr/bin/hyprland-monitor-attached ~/bin/on_mon_attach ~/bin/on_mon_detach
```

~/bin/on_mon_attach
```
hyprctl --batch ""keyword monitor HDMI-A-1,3840x2160,0x0,2;keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080,0x0,1,mirror,HDMI-A-1""
```

~/bin/on_mon_detach
```
hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,highres,auto,1
```

This is my new and current setup. I hoped this would also work, but it still had the exact same behaviour, perfectly fine when first connecting, but a crash when the HDMI cable disconnects from the laptop.

### How to reproduce

Using the above configuration (probably fixing resolutions), attach an HDMI cable into the device, and once its connected and displaying correctly disconnect it. Hyprland should freeze up and within a few seconds crash, taking you back to either tty or your login manager.

1982,Opaque region is not scaled to surface coordinates," region is an optimization to prevent drawing underneath opaque parts of windows.  Hyprland seems to respect the hint, but treats the region in px coordinates instead of surface coordinates.  This causes rendering artifacts when using 2x scaling which can be seen in eg. Chromium when using a transparent tabstrip.  This issue doesn't occur in sway.

In the below screenshot, you can see Chromium is in front of a white region, but only the upper-left quadrant of the tabstrip is showing white.

### How to reproduce

I don't know if this is specific to my setup. If not follow these steps:
1. Have at least two monitors
2. Have your cursor be at the right one when booting
3. Don't move the cursor
4. Pay attention to the top left corner of the left screen
5. You should see a ""ghost"" cursor that disappears as soon as you move your focus to the left monitor

2. In programs with their own cursor (retroarch) and games, a conflict of cursors occurs and either two cursors are drawn, system and game, or they are replaced alternately.
3. Also in the game starcraft remastered (proton xwayland), it happens that the true position of the cursor does not correspond to where it is drawn and, accordingly, it will not be possible to capture the controls, but after a while it passes",0

`hyprctl layers` reveals that the `gtk-layer-shell` eww layer remains visible after closing the bar or even killing the eww process.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

- Clone and build `eww-wayland`
- Make and open an eww window
- Close the window
- Quickly cycle through multiple workspaces before the eww window fades out completely

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

A ghost image of the bar remains for a few seconds when switching between workspaces quickly before disappearing completely",0

When using Firefox Picture-in-Picture mode to watch the video it only floats the first time, after closing the windows an opening again it is instead open as any other window. 
I'm pretty sure my config is correct, here is the relevant section:
```
windowrulev2 = float, class:(firefox),title:(Picture-in-Picture)
windowrulev2 = nofullscreenrequest, class:(firefox),title:(Picture-in-Picture)
windowrulev2 = nomaximizerequest, class:(firefox),title:(Picture-in-Picture)
windowrulev2 = pin, class:(firefox),title:(Picture-in-Picture)
```

I'm also attaching the full config just in case

### How to reproduce

Open any video on Firefox, right click and select Picture-in-Picture. Close the floating windows that open, Select Picture-in-Picture again. This time the window will act as any other window instead of floating. This will persist until Firefox is closed and reopened, then again only the first time will work.

477,"Mirroring displays crashes Hyprland, with different errorlog than previous other bugs","ow if this is exclusive to me or others have same bug, but when I connect a second monitor to my laptop, and use hyprctl to mirror the display, or set specific rules in the hyprland.conf, Hyprland straightup crashes.

Steps to reproduce, at least for me:
1. Have the following lines in hyprland.conf
2. Connect display 

Expected outcome:
Hyprland shouldn't crash, and both monitors should have mirrored output.

Noted outcome:
Hyprland crashes back to the tty login prompt immediately.

My hyprland.conf has these two lines to configure the monitor, as per the hyprland wiki documentation:

>monitor=eDP-1,preferred,auto,1
monitor=HDMI-A-1,preferred,auto,1,mirror,eDP-1




The relevant hyprland.log is:

When you have 3 or more windows on 1 monitor horizontally tiled and 1 of them has the minimal width you can increase width of any other window until width of other window becomes less than 0, which causes a crash.


### How to reproduce

1) Have 3 windows horizontally tiled.
2) Make 1 window have minimal possible width.
3) Increase width of any other window
4) Get crashed to swaylock

2572,"hyprland crashes on movetoworkspace,-1"," the bug**
in my config file:
bind=SUPERALTCTRL,left,movetoworkspace,-1
When I ask for this action (movetoworkspace,-1, which in my understanding will move the window to the previous workspace, as -1 should be interpreted as relative as per https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland/wiki/Advanced-config), this crashes hyprland. This is totally reproducible.

Same behaviour with 
```bash
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace -1
```
while 
```bash
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace +1
```
works as expected and moves the window to workspace+1

1072,Tablet Issue with fractional scaling and xwayland apps (force_zero_scaling=true),"

Hi all, 

I was trying a wacom intuos medium tablet on Hyprland (specifically with Aseprite and Krita, two apps that can only run with xwayland). On my display I have fractional scaling with 1.5, and on xwayland I enabled the force_zero_scaling setting. My problem is that the tablet can only reach 2/3 of the screen in those apps. If I set the 1.5 setting back to zero, this problem disappears. 

Couldn't find someone else with similar problems, so I figure this is the best place to ask. Not sure if this is the issue with Hyprland or issues with xwayland apps. 

Thanks!

Related Configs:
```
monitor=HDMI-A-1, 2560x1440,1920x0,1.5
monitor=eDP-1, preferred, auto, 1.75

xwayland {
	force_zero_scaling = true
}

...

device:wacom-intuos-bt-m-pen { 
	transform=2560x1440
	output=HDMI-A-1
}

2154,"On hybrid graphics, blacklisting NVIDIA modules causes delay in windows opening","aptop with inegrated graphics (Intel UHD 630) and discrete graphics (renderer: NVIDIA GeForce GTX with Max-Q Design/PCIe/SSE2).
NVIDIA's power management for this card is... not particularly good, so if I want to save power, I sometimes blacklist the following modules on boot via kernel parameters: `nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset`. This usually means it doesn't turn on at all, giving me 5-8W idle power usage instead of 15-18W.

However, when running Hyprland with these modules blacklisted, window creation is delayed by more than 2 seconds. 
Without blacklisting these modules, 

## Steps to reproduce
* Boot with the following kernel parameters added: `module_blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset`
* Run Hyprland
* Attempt to open windows

Different applications seem to act differently. I tested a couple, with the results below.
## Window creation testing
Large (~2.3-2.5s) delay? Appears to vary
* Kitty (any window)
* Firefox (first opened window)
* Waybar (first time)

Small (noticeable though) delay:
* Thunar
* Firefox's second window
* running kitty with `KITTY_DISABLE_WAYLAND=1 kitty`

running `kitty` from a kitty window within Hyprland has the same delay, and gives:
```
[glfw error 65544]: process_desktop_settings: failed with error: [org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod] No such interface “org.freedesktop.portal.Settings” on object at path /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop
```

Hitting ctrl+enter (my keybind to launch kitty) continuously does nothing until the delay is up, and then they _all appear at the same time_.

## Related packages, config
`hyprland-git`: r2060.250d61e-1, apparently release `6.0.9-arch1-1`, 
`xdg-desktop-portal`: 1.15.0-1
`xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`: 1.14.0-1

NVIDIA modules are not in my `mkinitcpio` precisely so I can do this hacky powersaving, though my Hyprland wrapper does have the lines specified at https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/

## Logs
I redirected Hyprland's output to a file (as well as current kernel parameters) so you can see what might be up. In each session, I run a script (`runKittiesAndThunar`) to launch 3 kitty instances and 1 thunar instance. Knda wish the logs had timestamps, happy to rerun with those enabled if there's a way. These are attached.
[intel.log](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/10056766/intel.log): followed the steps to reproduce
[intelNVIDIABlacklist.log](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/10056768/intelNVIDIABlacklist.log): did not blacklist any modules.

Whew. Sorry for that wall of text",0
77,Issue with `}` character in hyprland.conf commands,"

I have encountered an issue where commands containing the `}` character are not functioning as expected in hyprland.conf. It appears that if such commands are written in hyprland.conf, the entire command is not taking effect.

### How to reproduce

Add the following commands to hyprland.conf, test each command separately:
```
exec = echo ""hello"" && hyprctl dispatch movecursor 0 0
# exec = echo ""hello }"" && hyprctl dispatch movecursor 0 0
# exec = hyprctl dispatch movecursor 0 0 && echo ""hello }""
```
When saving, if you see the cursor move to position 0 0, it indicates that the command has been executed correctly. If the cursor does not move, then the command is ineffective.

1017,regression: cursor_inactive_timeout is broken,"

Dispatching `movefocus` now activates the cursor. Did a bisect, regression was introduced in 7a5234a0cca2508b7a5ede1fc60dc3ae8b72a51c.

### How to reproduce

- enable `cursor_inactive_timeout`
- move window focus
- cursor reappears

862,Artefacts and blur problems with wallpapers (?) and layers (?),"

There are artefacts and blur problems with wallpapers (?) and layers (?).

1. When starting Hyprland with my config I have blurry wallpapers, but when the first window is displayed, everything gets back to normal and works as it should. See screenshorts with a night city.
2. When nwg-bar is displayed/hidden, there are artefacts remaining on the wallpaper. Artefacts disappear when the first window is displayed.  See screenshots with a parrot.

### How to reproduce

I don't know how to reproduce it. I just have it when running my config. It seems that using programs that add other layers (waybar, nwg-bar etc) aggrevates the problem.

I didn't notice the problem on Hyprland ver. 0.30.0

3. Install fcitx5
4. Start `waybar` and then `fcitx5`
5. Hover the cursor over to the fcitx5 icon. `hyprland` crashes the moment the cursor enters the bounding box of `fcitx5` icon.

1161,0.29.1 breaks Waybar workspace names,"

After updating from to 0.29.1, my Waybar workspace names have disappeared.

Downgrading back to 0.28.0 fixes the issue and also another issue with black screens after inactivity.

Using `waybar-hyprland` nor `waybar-hyprland-git`, instead of `waybar`, fixes the issue.

### How to reproduce

Use my waybar config on `0.28.0` and then upgrade to `0.29.1`:

916,[BUG v0.32.3] Session is unlocked after recovering from unsafe state,"

Hey,
it's me again with some more monitor problems, I'm sorry :D
As per title, if the session is locked with swaylock (only one I've tried), and all monitors are disabled (putting Hyprland into unsafe state), reenabling one monitor gives full access to the computer.  
  
I've tried this on my laptop only.

### How to reproduce

1. Connect laptop to external monitor;
2. Disable laptop's monitor;
3. Run `swaylock -f; sleep 10 && hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,preferred,0x0,1.2`;
    1. alternatively, you can remove the `swaylock` call and just lock the screen yourself while the command is sleeping;
4. Remove the HDMI/DP cable (i.e., phisically disconect the external monitor);
5. Wait for the laptop's monitor to come back up...session is fully unlocked.

647,Huge Lag when reloading configuration,"

Whenever the config is reloaded (through ctrl+s for example) there is quite a huge lag-spike for abt 5/7 seconds.
Normally this would be fine as most people don't reload that often, but if you hold ctrl+s for even 1ms too long, it will stay pressed the entire lag-process, leading to all those ""s"" characters being printed after the lag.

### How to reproduce

Save the hyprland.conf file.

934,Special workspace not visible during workspace switching,"

Switching workspaces when a special workspace is visible, causes that special ws to hidden behind the windows on the non-special new workspace until the switching is finished.
Also, In my opinion switching a workspace with a visible special workspace should either keep the special focused (i would prefer that), or hide the special one.
The way it is now after switching the special is still visible but not focused, i think that is not usefull at all, and a state that can't be reached in other ways.

### How to reproduce

458,Cursor changes size when moving," I've configured GTK to use Bibata cursors theme.
- No XWayland.
- NVIDIA GPU.

# Issue


When you move the cursor on the desktop or just inside of a application like Brave or VSCodium it shrinks and expands by about 2px. To clarify, you don't have to move it between applications to notice this as it's happening continuously.

I'm having a hard time finding the culprit of this issue but some users suggests it's due to fractional scaling of bitmap icons?

# Config
I'm using NixOS and just using this option sets the cursor options globally without having to use `exec-once=hyprctl setcursor Bibata-Modern-Ice 22` or any other configuration:
```
home.pointerCursor = {
  gtk.enable = true;
  package = pkgs.bibata-cursors;
  name = ""Bibata-Modern-Ice"";
  size = 22;
};
```
For reference, if you configure the cursor with a alternative approach you get the same result:
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  
  ```
  # hyprland.conf
  exec-once=hyprctl setcursor Bibata-Modern-Ice 22
  ```

  # .nix
  gtk = {
    enable = true;
    cursorTheme = {
      package = pkgs.bibata-cursors;

I'm using a KVM switch to use two computers with the same monitors, keyboard and mouse.

Hyprland will sometime crash when I do that. I'm not sure, but I think it crashes only when I have an xwayland app opened (like Steam). I'll do some tests

- Start an xwayland app (EDIT: it seems to be related to Steam, I cannot manage to reproduce the crash with any other app. if Steam is opened, it crashes everytime)

2449,Weird exec behavior,"35d513bf55d5232936f017aa2697a6b4d64f6e6`
Okay so this started happening pretty recently, basically lets say in my config I have a exec-once to run my autostart files with dex (hasn't been updated in like a year so not a dex issue), so first of all I can't kill them normally, running `pkill app-name` doesn't work I have to use `pkill -KILL app-name`, and yes this doesn't happen when I run it from like kitty, and yes it started recently, secondly my policy-kit agent (pantheon-polkit, looks nice so thats what I use) (which I'm running with dex as a autostart file) wont appear, and yes I checked `hyprctl clients`, but it works just fine if I run the same command in kitty. Has something changed in the way stuff are executed? I'm a doing something wrong? id",0

^^^ note when I grab window with mouse and put back it sharpens.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have two monitors with different scaling.
2. Create window on lower scaled monitor.
3. Use shortcut (movewindow, movetoworkspace) to higher dpi monitor.

Expected behaviour:
Window is rescaled to 200%

Noted outcome:
Window is blurry like a xwayland app. It rescales only when is dragged with mouse. Window created in higher dpi monitor isn't affected.",0

1976,Crash with multiple users on same machine,"lo!  I am seeing that Hyprland does not like it when there are multiple users on the same machine who use hyperland.  My use case is that I have a machine that I like to use for both work and non-work, so I have 2 separate linux users (`grant` and `grant-work`).  

The issue comes from the fact that Hyprland creates a parent directory in `/tmp`.  So if I run Hyprland as `grant`,  the `/tmp/hypr` folder will be created, owned by `grant`.  If I then switch over to `grant-work` and attempt to run Hyprland, it will crash with a permissions issue, because `grant-work` cannot create a sub-directory in `/tmp/hypr`. 

The main issue stems from line 41 of Main.cpp:

https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/445f8c71c50ed9cdd72299b2ddf696b7baeb1b03/src/main.cpp#L41

I am wondering if we could change the temporary directory to include the username, so that multiple instances of Hyprland could be run on separate TTYs.  

I am happy to create a PR, but I'd love some guidance from the leadership of this project first :slightly_smiling_face:",0

1589,[regression?] (some?!) gtk/Qt apps suddenly have double cursor size (since 0.25.0) ,"ix issues, ping @fufexan -->
(@fufexan ? Not sure whether this is `nixos` related, or indirectly via updated flake deps referring to `wl` libs?)

Since using v. `0.25.0` I appear to have issues, [this one on AMD GPU](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/2213#issuecomment-1540757025) and [this one](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sudden-regression-wayland-some-apps-double-size-cursor/28170) on my laptop with `i915` (intel integrated) GPU.

This issue pertains to the second reference, but the first one might be relevant in relation to possible changed behaviour in WL libs?

At first I thought it might be a wider issue (not `Hyprland` specific, hence the post on NixOS discourse), but I tried running the same (in this case `chrome`) on `sway` on exactly the same system (`i915` GPU) with the same libs and the problem did not occur.

Note the details on the behaviour of the respective apps in the [above mentioned post](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sudden-regression-wayland-some-apps-double-size-cursor/28170). The strangest is that the scaling issue **only** affects the cursor (and for some the hotspot coordinates), but not the scaling of fonts and graphical elements.

Any ideas what might be causing this or how to debug this",0

1090,Poor performance in games after ~10 minutes,"

In the past couple weeks, I have been troubleshooting degraded performance in all games after about 10 minutes. The stutter/lag goes away if I switch my session to KDE/GNOME and remains after I restart Hyprland.

At first, I thought this was something to do with my video driver. But after further investigation, I have found that this issue is isolated to Hyprland only.
I can be lagging in Hyprland, then kill it and launch another DE/WM. I will get full FPS here. Then if I go back to Hyprland, I will still have the poor performance. The only thing that ends up resolving the issue is a full system reboot, then after about 10-20 mins of gameplay I'm lagging in Hyprland again.
  
If I restart CS2 in Hyprland after I have played for ~10 min, I will be down to 60fps in menus, and about 2/3 my normal FPS in game with heavy stutter. If I kill Hyprland (or every process by my user with pkill -U <username>) and restart, the lag and stutter is still there. From this point, the performance gets gradually worse over time.

When I have normal FPS, my GPU usage will be near 100%, but when this stutter happens my GPU is usually below 50% utilization.

I am using Arch linux with a 7900x+7900XTX, and running the games through gamescope. All games exhibit this behavior, and also happens without gamescope.


### How to reproduce

1. Play game under Hyprland (any Steam/Lutris games are doing this)
2. Have poor performance after about 10 minutes
3. Keep having poorer and poorer performance until full system reboot

1809,Moving workspace input bind key - Laptop,"
I have a problem with my keybind, i explain : 

when I try to change the page (with the right keys) the pages do not change, when I execute the command: hyprctl dispatch workspace 2, it works

I tried to change several times the key, I looked at the doc a lot of times but it doesn't work.

In fact I have the impression that Hyprland does not take the input from my keyboard, when I am on a terminal and I do my modkey + the key 1 of my keyboard, it marks me the result on my terminal, it does not change the workspace. I have tried with many different key combinations, but nothing works

538,Incorrect mouse position on refocus until moved,"

Mouse coordinates given to app are incorrect when a click is the first event it receives after being refocused. This is fixed the moment the mouse is moved again.


### How to reproduce

1. Open an Xwayland app for which the mouse position matters and which uses tooltips/subwindows
2. Get a tooltip to open
3. Click on the app
4. Observe that the position of that click is incorrect

Jetbrains IDE keeps rendering tooltip. The bug I have is identical to #2245 . It is working in v0.33.1.

I bisected and found ba2af6f86d26fbf4b51aa37bf901e0118f46bbe3 to be faulty.

Reverting the commit on top of bfb4d66c8144a36f2c52530f10ae4bac2ac03b09 removes the bug.

### How to reproduce

Open a JetBrains IDE and leave mouse idle on left bar buttons. The tooltip will flicker, opening and closing repeatedly.

There is a video in the older ticket #2245 .

225,Swaylock/waylock lose focus after resume,"

I have this issue where sometimes swaylock/waylock (it happens for either of them) don't get focus when resuming from sleep. This is not always the case so I haven't been able to pin-point the issue. When it happens, sometimes the mouse cursor is visible but then goes away after pressing any key. Trying to input the password does not work at all and the screen remains black (but still lit). Then I have to kill swaylock from another tty to be able to access the system.

I have swaydle setup so that is turns off the screen before it locks it and the screen is locked using a the lockscreen script below.

I hope this is not a duplicate issue since I have not been able to find anybody else having the same problem.

hyprland config:
```
exec-once = swayidle -w timeout 400 'hyprctl dispatch dpms off' resume 'hyprctl dispatch dpms on' timeout 700 'lockscreen' timeout 1000 'systemctl suspend' lock 'lockscreen' before-sleep 'lockscreen'
```

lockscreen script:
```
#!/bin/sh
playerctl -a pause

dunst_old=$(dunstctl is-paused)
dunstctl set-paused true # pause dunst

# mute
pactl set-sink-mute 0 true

pidof swaylock > /dev/null || swaylock -d >> /tmp/lockscreen.log 2>&1

# wait for swaylock to finish
wait $!

dunstctl set-paused ""$dunst_old"" # restore dunst state

```

swaylock config:
```
color=000000
show-keyboard-layout
daemonize
ignore-empty-password
```

### How to reproduce

1. Setup swayidle and swaylock as above.
2. Make the system sleep (either by the timers expiring or by closing the laptop's lid)
3. When the system wakes up, try to enter a password and fail

This is very inconsistent and I haven't been able to find out what exactly triggers it. But I have been having the problem quite frequently.

Any suggestions on how to pin-point the cause are greatly appreciated! I'm guessing it's probably missconfiguration.

As a final remark: I haven't had the same problem with gtklock, which does not support wayland's screen lock protocol, so maybe that has something to do with it. However, I haven't used gtklock for very long so maybe it would show up eventually.

This is true for all master layout dispatchers. `swapnext` happens to work but I notice this dispatcher is included in the [non-layout specific list](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dispatchers/) and has a slightly different syntax than the one described in the master layout list (has a possible `prev` argument separated by a comma).

Two options (seems to have to do with dpms): 
1. ` systemctl suspend`
2. ` sleep 1 && hyprctl dispatch dpms off`
2a. ` sleep 1 && hyprctl dispatch dpms on`

Expected outcome

1. system suspends, resumes upon keyboard / mouse input.
2. I'm not quite sure, to be honest. I think the default is off, according to waybar`s idle indicator.  
2a. Waybar idle indicator is set to active? Screen should timeout while away? Screen shoud turn back on if off? 
    
Noted outcome

1. system suspends, screen enters energy saving state, but then computer immediately wakes and screen remains black. No input is registered, that I'm aware of. Must force a restart to continue. 
2. Screen should not timeout until turned back on. Seems to do nohting if it's already off. See 2a.
2a. Screen turns black. I still receive audio input and I think the keyboard works. I re-ran command via terminal to turn dps off while screen is black, but then audio disconnects and appears input of any kind is halted (cannot switch to new tty)

967,Qt scaling issue,"

I wrote about it [here](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/7926#event-10455031204). Basically qutebrowser's scaling is very bad when hyprland scaling is set to anything but 1. I've seen [this](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/pixelated-text-anki-in-hyprland-and-plasma-wayland-with-scaling-1-25/33746) so my guess is that hyprland scales Qt applications wrong

1 scale:
![1 0](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/47274578/5104da33-3b8f-4f54-9f5b-83766a061a7b)

Another thing to note: when qutebrowser is already started and I rewrite scaling 1 -> 1.1 - the browser looks fine. But as soon as I start qutebrowser under 1.1 scaling - it looks blurry

### How to reproduce

- Have `follow_mouse` set to either `0` or `2`
- Have a multi monitor setup:
    - Monitor A: this has focus
    - Monitor B: this does not have focus, and does not have any windows (so an empty workspace)
- Click on the desktop B: It does not obtain focus.
    - (If a window is on monitor B, then clikcing it will result in the workpsace/monitor to obtain focus)

Interestingly, when I change the GTK theme, the extent of the cut-off area seems to vary – it can either increase or decrease.

896,[Plugins] Cannot hook to listener_monitorDestroy,"

Hi!
So, this must be me getting something wrong, but I've been trying for several hours and I really don't know what's going on.

I'm trying to hook to `Events::listener_monitorDestroy` (`events/Monitors.cpp`, line 184). The hook itself seems to be successfull, but when I call the original function, Hyprland crashes with no useful logs :/.
Debugging into it, the original events function never gets called, Hyprland crashes the moment I call the original function from my code. I've also verified that pointers are valid at that point.  
Notice that I'm also hooking to `listener_newOutput`, and calling its original function works successfully

Now, to the weird part (which leads me to believe it's my fault probably):  
If I compile Hyprland with `make debug`, the call to the original function works perfectly, no crashes whatsoever.

Could you please help me verify whether this is my fault or Hyprland's?

84,force_zero_scaling caused some coordinate issues,"

When the monitor scaling is not 1, enabling `force_zero_scaling` causes some weird coordinate issues.

1. Open a context menu in Xwayland app (e.g., Microsoft Edge) and close it **without moving the cursor** (by pressing ESC or clicking the left mouse button). The cursor will be relocated to a position slightly to the upper left.
2. After entering some text, the candidate window (e.g., IDEA's code completion, fcitx) will move to the slightly lower right corner.

I have conducted extensive searches and testing after noticing these issues. Eventually, I realized that they all appear to be associated with force_zero_scaling, and here are some possibly related issues: #2579 #2879 #2880

### How to reproduce

1. Set monitor scaling > 1, force_zero_scaling = true
2. Open an Xwayland app, such as MS Edge.
3. Right-click to open the context menu and keep the cursor stationary.
4. Press ESC to close the context menu while maintaining the stationary cursor, then click the right mouse button.
5. It will be observed that the new context menu opens in the upper-left with an offset.

Leaving out the line entirely (defaults) also makes windows lack any animations.

2557,Hardcoded /tmp/hypr problematic,"s looks like an interesting project.

While looking at the code I noticed that the hardcoded paths `/tmp/hypr/hyprland.log` and `/tmp/hypr/.socket.sock` which will break if more than one instance of hyprland is running.

I would suggest making use of the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variables for the socket file. Eg replace using `/tmp/hyper/` with `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}-hypr/`.

This location should be fine for the socket, but strictly speaking, log files shouldn't go under ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}. However, I'm guessing that the currently implemented logging will be changed as hyprland becomes more mature. Is there any reason not to use `wlr_log()` provided by wlroots?

551,gaps_out needs window refresh when set from a script,"

When running the command ```hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out 15``` from inside a script or a tmux session the window needs currently displayed windows need to refresh to respect the new setting.
The refresh can be achieved through:
1. changing workspaces
2. resizing the window
3. using movewindow

When runnning from inside a normal terminal it works.

### How to reproduce

Run the command ```hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out 15``` from a script or inside a tmux session.

2484,Cannot move to or use workspace 2," hyprland installed and everything works fine, except for specifically workspace 2. All others can be moved to and used like normal, except for 2.

Steps to reproduce:
Move to workspace 2/Move a window to workspace 2

Expected outcome:
Hyprland moves to workspace 2/moves the window to workspace 2

Noted outcome:
Hyprland does nothing when attempting to move to workspace 2/freezes and overlays the current window on top of all workspaces when attempting to move said window to workspace 2

I've also tried using `hyprctl kill` on those windows after they freeze, and I'm unable to even click on them. All Hyprland will do is kill the current window on top of the frozen one.

Hyprland crashes when a window with `windowrulev2 = move onscreen cursor...` and larger than the display size is opened.

### How to reproduce

Open a floating window with `windowrulev2 = move onscreen cursor...` where the window + borders is larger than the display size.

E.g., if I my active monitor is 1920x1080 and I have in my config:
```
general {
    border_size = 2
}

windowrulev2 = float, class:Alacritty
windowrulev2 = move onscreen cursor, class:Alacritty
windowrulev2 = size 1920 1080, class:Alacritty
```

If I open Alacritty, Hyprland will crash. This will happen for any window that opens with a width greater than 1916 or height greater than 1076.

439,"Keyboard losing focus, after using a floating popup (IntelliJ / Java?)","using a floating popup in IntelliJ (like 'Generate' popup), I am losing keyboard focus completely when the popup closes. I need to focus some other window (or change workspace) and refocus the original window to be able to type again. Mouse clicks within the application do not help. 

PS: The issue does not happen if I use mouse to close the popup, only if I'm using keyboard.

I've tried changing the follow_mouse option, but the behavior is the same. 
I will not post the config, since I was able to reproduce the issue even without the config (with the yellow banner on top ;-))

It might be easier to show on a video: https://youtu.be/HVOS8_YDTDo (I am clicking the mouse and typing after the popup closes multiple times), but no keyboard input goes through.

Thank you for your time!

1940,Some flatpak apps don't follow pre-assigned workspaces on startup," up some startup apps that I want to launch namely:

1. qBittorrent on Workspace 1
2. Nicotine+ on Workspace 2

All 3 of them being flatpaks. However, out of the 3, only Nicotine follows is it's assigned workspace, qBittorrent tries, Librewolf launches in Workspace 1 anyways for reasons that are alien to me

I followed a guide online (dont have the link on me rn) and it instructed me to create a shell script the works on launch to assign the apps the windows, while the startup applications being executed in the config itself

The lines relevant in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` are:
```ini

exec-once = io.gitlab.librewolf-community
exec-once = org.qbittorrent.qBittorrent

windowrule = workspace 2 silent,org.nicotine_plus.Nicotine
windowrule = workspace 3 silent,io.gitlab.librewolf-community

Where, startup.sh is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
hyprctl keyword windowrule ""workspace 2 unset,org.nicotine_plus.Nicotine""
hyprctl keyword windowrule ""workspace 3 unset,io.gitlab.librewolf-community""

385,cursor_inactive_timeout and OS cursor in gaming,"ing my cursor hide when I am working so I have set a `cursor_inactive_timeout` but with it set I am having it reappear in games which is quite distracting. With variable set to 0 I am not experiencing any problems.

I am not sure if this is related to me using an NVidia GPU (I have followed all the instructions on the wiki as far as I can tell) or maybe just the `env = WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS,1` or if this is a more widespread issue with AMD as well so it would be nice to have a record in the issue tracker even if this is close as unsupported due to NVidia drivers if that turns out to be the case.

Please let me know if you need more info from me regarding the issue.

# Steps to reproduce
1. set `cursor_inactive_timeout = 5`
2. launch a game (tested with subnautica, monument valley and doom eternal via steam)
3. let the cursor disappear while the game is launching
4. wait for in-game cursor to appear
5. move the mouse
# Expected outcome
OS cursor does not appear

OS cursor appears alongside the in-game one (sometimes in a different place)

Installed basic hyprland setup for arch linux inside a vm. 3D acceleration is active. I triple-checked that all dependencies are installed.
Running `Hyprland` shows the default installation with the basic config. Pressing SUPER + Q to open kitty crashes the entire vm.
Says it wants to read some specific memory address. The address never changes. No crash report was generated.

The file manager dolphin works just fine, though I did not test any other applications.

### How to reproduce

1. Install basic arch linux using the latest iso on a vm.
2. Follow the hyprland installation tutorial.
3. Run hyprland and press SUPER + Q

# The problem

When I turn off and on my 4K monitor, GTK apps become blurry, possibly due to rendering in FullHD. This issue occurs in apps such as Firefox, PCManFM, and Emacs-pgtk. It is worth mentioning that this issue doesn't happen in Sway.

1105,Permissions change on Hyprland binary crashes plugins,"

Some plugins use `nm` to obtain symbols from binaries. Hyprland's plugin API provides an explicit function to search for functions by name in this way. As an example, here's a snippet from my own plugin:

```cpp
    // Get address of the private CHyprDwindleLayout::getNodeFromWindow member function, we'll need it in toggleGroup
    static const auto METHODS = HyprlandAPI::findFunctionsByName(PHANDLE, ""getNodeFromWindow"");
    g_pNodeFromWindow = (nodeFromWindowT)METHODS[1].address;

    for (auto& method : METHODS) {
        if (method.demangled == ""CHyprDwindleLayout::getNodeFromWindow(CWindow*)"") {
            g_pNodeFromWindow = (nodeFromWindowT)method.address;
            break;
        }
    }
```

However since commit 3f09b14, the permissions of the Hyprland binary were changed to 711, which means non-root users will now only have execute permissions over the binary, but not a read permission.

This means the `nm` process crashes when it attempts to read the binary, which in turn crashes Hyprland as a whole once this function is performed. As most plugins will do this from `PLUGIN_INIT`, this can present itself as an immediate crash.

### How to reproduce

Create a plugin whcih calls the `HyprlandAPI::findFunctionsByName` function to obtain a pointer to a hyprland fucntion from the binary symbols.

The game draws the windows, it even uses the in-game cursor theme, but it won't receive any inputs. 

According to this #433 issue the root of the causes suppose to be wine/proton's fault. But 0ad actually works natively and works  flawlessly under sway and wayfire.

Another thing to mention, why is most game aren't launching fullscreen automatically?

491,New comment escaping with `##` should not apply to lines that begin with `##`,"

After upgrading I had dozens of configuration errors in the error popup. It was hard to track down but the issue was because I was using `##` to prefix section titles in my config to distinguish them from regular commented lines. The changelog for the latest version mentions that `##` escapes commenting now, but I think this should be ignored for lines where the first character is `#`. I changed my titling format for now but it took a while to identify the cause.

Also as a slightly related feature request, can the error popups have an optional timeout to disappear? I had hundreds of errors and it took up my entire screen so I couldn't see anything underneath and couldn't debug the issue. I had to set the `debug:suppress_errors` attribute, but then I also had trouble seeing the configuration errors since I couldn't find an option to print those to the logs.

### How to reproduce

Have any lines in your config that start with `##`, or in other words matches the regex `^##.*$`

1236,Passed Binds Sometimes Act As Non-Consuming Binds,"

When passing a bind to an application (in my case = `bind=,KP_Prior,pass,^(discord)$`), the bind acts as a non-consuming bind and will be sent to the currently application. This causes me to either scroll up or type 9 when using this bind, which seems to be unintended behaviour.

This behaviour seems to differ between applications. I have observed the following with these binds:
`bind=,h,pass,^(discord)$`: 
- Discord does not accept the passed bind unless it is focused.
- Firefox does not type `h` on press, but the current text field is highlighted.
- VSCode will type `h` on press.
- Kitty will not type `h` on press.

`bind=,h,pass,^(firefox)$`:
- Firefox types `h` when passed from an outside program.
- Kitty, Discord, and VSCode will not type `h`.

`bind=,KP_Prior,pass,^(discord)$`
- Kitty and Firefox intercept the bind and Discord does not receive it.
- The bind is correctly passed to Discord in VSCode.

### How to reproduce

1. Add a passed keybind with no preceding modifier key.
2. Attempt to use this bind in various apps.

1135,"Cannot set Environment Variables with ""hyprctl keyword""","

I am using the build from the Official Arch Repositories. I am attempting to use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for var in $(run-parts /usr/lib/systemd/user-environment-generators | sed '/:$/d; /^$/d'); do
    IFS=""="" read -ra PARTS <<<""$var""
    hyprctl keyword env ""${PARTS[0]},${PARTS[1]}""
done
```

However this doesn't result in any environment variables being added to my `printenv` output. I also checked after restarting my terminal emulator. I've also tried executing the script through `hyprctl dispatch exec` and as a `exec-once` in my config. I've even tried just running `hyprctl keyword env Test,Test`, just ensure it wasn't my script. All calls to hyprctl does output ""ok"".

An alternative to all this would just be someway for Hyprland to source variables from ~/.config/environment.d. The above script was just my attempt to do so.

### How to reproduce

Execute `hyprctl keyword env Test,Test` and then check output of `printenv`.

1874,Cannot rotate the screen,"otate the screen
> Sorry for my previous issue open to misinterpretation.


I recently find that transforming/rotating the screen/monitor by any degree (e.g. 90, 180) is not possible.
I have used hyprctl, hyprland.config and wdisplays to do it and none of them works.
Hyprcrtl returns Ok but nothing happens.

# Reproduction of the problem
I tried to read the log, it seems that the manager did not receive the transform command.
For example, if I try `transform 1`, the log output is still `transform 0`. 
As you may see, I have my hyprland config as below:
```
monitor=DP-8,preferred,auto,1
workspace=DP-8,1
```
However,  my log shows the transform parameter of DP-8 is still `0`:

780,Systemd service startup notification?,"

Hi.
Since example systemd unit contains `Type            = notify`, I wonder if Hyprland detects being in a systemd service and sends notification itself?

And if it is, is it possible to disable or tune this behavior?

A user of my [session manager](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm/) encountered [breakage](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm/issues/14) of startup ordering that happens due to early startup declaration.

The first one is noticably darker.

However, if I set `ignore_opacity=false;` in `blur` settings, then the blurred one is not dark anymore, however, it doesn't blur anything either.

(if it's by design, sorry and please let me know how to make blur not get dark while keeping it actually blurring)

### How to reproduce

The first one: set `blur` to enable and `ignore_opacity` to true.

The second one:
1. Either disable blur
2. Or enable `forcergbx`
3. Or set `ignore_opacity` to false

252,Non-standard forced resolution error,"

When I specify a resolution in the configuration file that is not part of the EDID, such as 75Hz, it almost either crashes or has serious wayland issues - such as GDK IS MONITOR assertion errors and runtime errors.

I discovered this issue using an Intel Iris Xe graphics card, but I found that it appears to be the same issue with my Intel Core graphics card on a desktop that is running normally.

Is this a design or implementation problem in wayland or does it come from the driver? I know that driver issues are not the responsibility of the wayland community to fix or maintain, but I wanted to confirm if this is normal for wayland and if there is room for improvement, e.g. automatic notification when unsupported display settings are detected The administrator issued an error message!

1269,Broken XWayland scaling on monitors with different resolutions,"

I have 2 monitors: one 1080p (DP-2) and one 2160p (DP-1).
Following the instructions from the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/XWayland/), I added the  changes in my config file (see below).

Using these settings, opening an application with XWayland on the high-res monitor works perfectly, it's scaled correctly and everything is crisp and clear.
However, once I move the window to the low-res monitor, it's scaled incorrectly, meaning everything is twice as large as it should be.

I tried it with disabling `force_zero_scaling` and setting `GDK_SCALE=1`. This makes the application look great on the low-res monitor, but on the high-res monitor it's pixelated (but the scale is correct).

Is there anything I am missing here or is this setup just not supported yet?

### How to reproduce

Connect a low-res and high-res monitor with different scaling factors and use the following config:

```
monitor=DP-1,highres,auto,2
monitor=DP-2,preferred,auto,1

xwayland {
  force_zero_scaling = true
}

env = GDK_SCALE,2
env = XCURSOR_SIZE,32
```

Then open an application with `GDK_BACKEND=x11`.

1044,When being in fullscreen and opening a floating window it behaves as it has windowrule 'noinitialfocus',"

When being in fullscreen (pseudo or not doesn't matter) mode and opening a floating window (`bind = SUPERCTRL, Return, exec, [float] foot`), it appears on top of fullscreen window, but isn't focused, like there is a 'noinitialfocus' rule, but there isn't. I am aware of `new_window_takes_over_fullscreen`, but when set to 2 it just unfullscreens me whenever any floating window pops up (ie steam friends playing something), which is really annoying. So this value is set to 0 for me and i can't replicate old behavior when newly opened floating windows weren't behind the stack and were opening having focus right away without me clicking on them.

What i need (and it was an old behavior) is whenever i am in (pseudo) fullscreen mode and open floating windows they are on top of the stack and getting focus right away. And any new tiled windows opened in (pseudo)fullscreen mode respecting whether i was in pseudo or true fullscreen (now they don't , they always go true fullscreen even if i was in pseudo). How can i achieve that? No values of `new_window_takes_over_fullscreen` works as an old behavior right now.

### How to reproduce

Steps to reproduce:

- create 2 tiling windows
- go (pseudo)fullscreen
- open any floating window with bind command above

Another issue - newly opened windows also don't get focus, steps to reproduce:

- create 2 tiling window
- go (pseudo)fullscreen
- open any window (like bind=SUPER,Return,exec,footclient)
- it appears behind the stack, and if new_window_takes_over_fullscreen is set to 1 it ignores whether i was in pseudofullscreen on in true fullscreen and just always goes true fullscreen.

1279,Discord screen sharing still not working even after applying patch,"

Recently after installing Hyprland on my computer I realized Discord screen sharing did not work. As recommended by the wiki, I followed [this](https://gist.github.com/PowerBall253/2dea6ddf6974ba4e5d26c3139ffb7580) guide on fixing screen sharing. This did not appear to work actually made things worse, breaking audio and mic. I managed to to fix that by installing the pipewire-pulse package.

### How to reproduce

Install Hyprland (on arch) with Nvidia card, install Discord, apply patch.

120,movewindow left won't work when default_split_ratio setting is active.,"

The configured binding for moving window left does not work when combined with setting: `default_split_ratio = 1.1`, my keybinding is `binde = SUPER, Left, movewindow, l`.  The whole related configs are:

```ini
dwindle {
    default_split_ratio = 1.1 # 1 means 5/5 split
}

binde = $mainMod, Left, movewindow, l
```

Linux 6.6.9-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue, 02 Jan 2024 02:28:28 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

### How to reproduce

Set the following three config at once:

```
binde = SUPER, Left, movewindow, l
general {
    layout = dwindle
}
dwindle {
    default_split_ratio = 1.1 # 1 means 5/5 split

590,wine under vulkan not working issue,"

so basicaly idk if its a bug or what,so i am using garuda linux hyprland which comes pre configured and i followed the https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/ site in order to make the nvidia work and its working fine i have nvidia gt 740m and using the nvidia-470xx-utils  as the main arch site suggested for my card so what i faced while working with lutris anything i launch using it gives error 
```
libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen
MESA-INTEL: warning: Haswell Vulkan support is incomplete
ERROR:             ICD associated with VkPhysicalDevice does not support GetPhysicalDeviceCalibrateableTimeDomainsKHR
```


first this ``MESA-INTEL: warning: Haswell Vulkan support is incomplete`` didnt show untill after couple search and checking what the issue where i didnt find anywhere i though i just need to install vulkan as i found out its the issue 

so what i concluded is that the ``nvidia-470xx-utils`` doesn't work with hyprland under vulkan since when i use the defaul nouevu driver the everything in lutris work well  but i prefer ``nvidia-470xx-utils`` because it has better performance and battery life 

lastly thanks for this awesome desktop its pretty cool and easy to configure and pretty lightwieght with cool animations i am using it for 2 days now and its awesome thanks for the team

### How to reproduce

grab nvidia gt 740m card  and try it lmao

787,Recursive Variable Definition Results in Infinite Loop,"

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your dedication and hard work in developing this exceptional compistor. The addition of the zooming functionality has been particularly beneficial and is greatly appreciated.

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have encountered with Hyprland. It appears to be a bug that triggers an infinite loop, ultimately leading to a crash. This issue seems to stem from a recursive variable definition.

Ideally, Hyprland should be able to detect this situation and respond by throwing an error. However, in this case, it appears to enter an infinite loop and subsequently crashes.

### How to reproduce

 Here is the configuration snippet that reproduces the issue:

````
$a = any-command; $a
bind = , a,exec, $a
````

Once again, thank you for your commitment to this project and for the remarkable work you have done thus far.

2153,Game window never appears after launching it (Dying Light 2),"eproduce:
Start game (Dying light 2 for me) via Steam. 

Noted outcome:
The initial splash screen appears, then dissapears.
After that the game should start and it does, but no window appears, just the music from the game in the background.

Expected outcome:
Game window should be visible after starting it.

Not sure it matters, but I'm running a 3 monitor setup and the splashscreen atleast does not appear on the same monitor that I launched Steam on.

PS: When launching The Binding of Isaac I can get the window to appear by turning off fullscreen and then going fullscreen again. That does not work with Dying Light 2 though.",0
1174,Glob in `source` does not support full path names,"

The `source` globbing implemented in #3276 does not support full path globs like `/home/nixos/.config/overrides/hyprland/*.conf`.

When using this, I get an error message saying
```
source= glob error
```

When replacing the string with `~/.config/overrides/hyprland/*.conf` the configuration works, which doesn't work with the way configuration is managed with `home-manager` under NixOS.

home-manager abstracts the `~/.config` folder location into the `${config.xdg.configHome}` variable, which yields a full path, not a relative path.

591,"Dynamic rules with ""floating"" condition do not work for windows floated by a rule","

If a `float` rule applies to a window, dynamic rules with a `floating` condition will always act as if the window was floating.

### How to reproduce

1. Add the following window rules and ensure other rules aren't interfering with them (any application can be used instead of `swayimg`):
```conf
windowrulev2 = float,class:^(swayimg)$
windowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(00ff00),class:(swayimg),floating:1
windowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(ff0000),class:(swayimg),floating:0
```
2. Open a `swayimg` (or whatever you chose) window. It will have a green border.
3. Un-float the window. It will still have a green border, despite the `floating:1` condition and the third rule.
4. Remove the `float` rule.
5. Toggle the floating state of the window. The border color will now change as expected.

I have installed Onlyoffice **for the first time** (so I don't know if it happened on previous versions), to see if it would behave better with a few .doc documents from a colleague and it preserves the structure of the document better. 

I've tried both flatpak (v. 7.3.0) and AUR [onlyoffice-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/onlyoffice-bin) package (v. 7.3.3-1). Both of them are **terribly** slow, to the point that it is completely unusable. Maybe half a minute to open and be able to make a single click. 10 seconds to open a file, after 20 seconds to click the open menu... 20 seconds to scroll or type... same to adjust the size if you change the window size...

1954,Cursor snaps back to original position after dragging event in certain applications.,"Issue**
In certain applications, my cursor resets it's position after dragging on the screen. On further inspection, it appears to only occur in applications where some kind of cursor constraints are applied. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8363722/217341660-d868c888-a2b0-4694-a8bf-b1fca261d22a.mp4

**Findings**
- At first I thought this was an issue exclusively to blender. It happened after dragging panels and moving objects in the 3d viewport. However, the same issue occurs in VMWare player when clicking and dragging anywhere.
- I know blender constrains the cursor with wayland support ([this](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/98714) issue seems very similar). VMware Player also seems like it expects to lock a cursor to the VM.
- Before making this issue, I tried to reproduce the problem with Gnome DE (both Wayland and Xorg) and even another wlroots based compositor (Sway), but to no avail. That's why I believe this issue may be specific to Hyprland.
- With blender, this problem only occurs when running in Wayland mode. (sidenote: this also causes blender to open in a ""fake fullscreen mode"", where it seems to ignore all windows and just open across the screen. Only after opening the preferences window, blender returns to being regularly tiled). When opening blender with xwayland, this issue does not occur. With VMWare player the issue occurs, even though it's run with xwayland.
- I DO use Hyprland-nvidia-git with an RTX 3080, if that matters. I installed the nvidia-open-dkms on the regular linux kernal for Arch linux 6.1.9-arch1-2. 


---
**Steps to reproduce**
- Install Blender - or possibly another application with cursor constraints(?)
- press mouse button down and move the cursor
- release mouse button

**Expected Outcome**
- Cursor position after release should be the same as the cursor position on release

**Noted Outcome**
- Cursor position returns to the position the cursor was at when the mouse was clicked",0

554,Binding $mainMod + Shift + e dosen't work as expected,"

Hey there!

I was trying to figure out why my script kept crashing hyprland _(or so I thought)_ every time I tried to run it when bound like this:
```
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, e, exec, /path/to/script
```

Took entirely way to long for me to try binding a different key, only to find out that apparently `$mainMod SHIFT, e` is hardcoded _somewhere_ to exit hyprland.

Where is this defined? _Is_ it defined somewhere? I may also be missing something with the default config on my system, though I'd believe hypyland only uses the config in my `~/.config/hypr` if present.

I couldn't find anyone else having this issue, though it's kind of weird to search for.

Let me know if there's any more info I can provide!

### How to reproduce

In the config:
```
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, e, exec, /path/to/script
```

And experience it not working as expected.

1938,Hyprland crashes when connecting a VR headset,"e Monado OpenXR runtime crashes Hyprland as soon as the headset initialises. VR headsets are non-desktop screens and should be ignored according to the DRM-lease protocol (which Hyprland implemented with PR #588), but that seems not to be happening for whatever reason. Sway's implementation, which is what Hyprland's was based on as far as I understand, works correctly. 

The log shows the ""Not configuring non-desktop output"" debug line so I believe it gets identified correctly (Monitor.cpp, line 68), but then Hyprland apparently tries to configure the screen anyway?

The wallpaper of DP-1 loads in 3-5 seconds after all other screen have loaded completely. Next to this, it takes another 5 seconds to render the cursor and applications in the workspace under DP-1. This was not happening in the Hyprland version (pacman -S hypland).

As far as I can see WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 log (attached here) doesn't show anything suspicious and neither does the Hyprland log. Is it possible that Hyprland creates/assigns the wrong object somehow? Otherwise, it may be a library issue...

275,DIsconnecting middle monitors freezes inputs,"

Not really sure if this is a bug or feature request... a bit of both. But I have 3 external monitors, each specified with a fixed position in the config file, in order to have them in the right order. If I remove the middle one, pull the plug, then I am unable to still move my mouse between the now separated monitors. If I reconnect, it starts working again.

Ultimately this feels like I shouldn't be having to specific these exact monitor coordinates, and instead hyprland should have an xrandr style left-of, right-of syntax, so that the order of monitors is reliable and configurable, without having to know the exact screen dimensions, and in this instance, the exact number of screens.

Whilst the ""shortest"" expected behaviour should be to just allow a gap in the monitors and nothing stop working, the real solution should be to fully remove the missing monitor and rearrange the monitors to be directly adjacent. This doesn't appear to be possible given the opportunistic way multiple monitors are added when exact coords aren't provided.

### How to reproduce

Define 3 monitors with explicit coordinates
Disconnect the middle monitor
Try and use mouse to reach both the remaining monitors.
Mouse input should be seen to stop altogether.

I have the following minimal example:

```sh
for i in 1 2 3 4; do

  sleep 1
done
```

The notification shown does not replace the old one (as it should according to Dunst, and does work for my other scripts).

This is not the case if `notify-send` is run directly by the user.

I need to do this because the script's primary function requires superuser, and the script is marked as `NOPASSWD` in `/etc/sudoers`. Using `sudo` inline in the script only for the necessary commands is not an option.

What happens instead?

The first notification is shown correctly, any after that show up as a blurred rectangle in its place.

Here is a video where I first run the script, and then the `notify-send` commands individually, finally I copy and paste a contrived example from snippets of the script to demonstrate the commands should work as expected.

Note that for the first 30 seconds or so, I am waiting for the script to finish running. After that I start running things manually. Look in the top-right.

![image](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/5684325/a4ab7bf1-2d6a-46ac-862b-932367346c19)

The above is a screenshot from nvtop of Hyprlands resource usage in nvtop. I am using a radeon 680m igpu (that is on par with a GTX 1050 for those unfamiliar) and at 2560x1440 resolution.

Note if I plug in an extra monitor that's at standard UHD (4k) resolution all of Hyprland will turn laggy.

Even if  I disable compositing with this:

```
    hyprctl --batch ""\
        keyword animations:enabled 0;\
        keyword decoration:drop_shadow 0;\
        keyword decoration:blur:passes 0;\

        keyword general:gaps_out 0;\
        keyword general:border_size 1;\
        keyword decoration:rounding 0""
```

it'll only drop by maybe 20% or so, it's still using about half of the igpu. This is **extremely** gpu heavy, it isn't hard to find 3D games that are less heavy than this.

On a two monitor setup, with Dwindle layout, using a keybind for `movewindow, mon:+1` on e.g. workspace 1, when switching back to the previous monitor with `focusmonitor +1` no window is focused on that workspace. Doing pretty much anything other than `focusmonitor +1` again on workspace 1 focuses a window back.

1250,BeamNG native Linux port randomly crashes whole system only on Hyprland,"

Let me say something first, BeamNG native Linux port is in early testing and is highly unstable and crashes often under any compositor or XOrg session and even with my old GTX 1080. However, it should not take my system with it ideally. It crashes so badly that even pressing power or switching to TTY sometimes doesn't work. If you don't own this game, I can either do the testing for you if you give me instructions, or I can maybe let you remote into my box

3. Run the executable and load the game
4. take notice that screen flickers sometimes when loading in fullscreen or just crashes in same way when loading
5. Play the game for a while drive etc.
6. It crashes and brings the whole system with it

226,movefocus doesn't work as expected with multiple monitors,"

Suppose you have 2 windows side by side on monitor 1, called A and B. Additionally, monitor 1 is placed on top of monitor 2 with 2 side by side windows B and C.
Monitor 1: | A  B |
Monitor 2: | C D |

When focused on window A on monitor 1, calling `movefocus d` moves the focus to window C as expected.

Monitor 1: |   A   |
Monitor 2: | C D |
However, if you first go into full screen on window A and then call `movefocus d`, this results in cycling through windows A,B rather than moving focus to C or D. 
I would expect moving to C or D.

Related:
Monitor 1: | A  B |
Monitor 2: | C D |
Call `movewindow d` while focused on A. Results in A moving as expected. Same for B.
Monitor 1: |    B    |
Monitor 2: | A C D |

Monitor 1: | A  B |
Monitor 2: | C D |
However, calling `movewindow u` while focused on C does not move it up but instead swaps it with D.
Monitor 1: | A  B |
Monitor 2: | D  C |
I would expect it to move window C up to monitor 1.

And now when we do these same operations while in fullscreen, nothing happens at all:

Monitor 1: |   A   |
Monitor 2: | C D |
Full screen on window A. Call `movewindow d` while focused on A, nothing happens. Same if A is the only window on monitor 1. 
Same deal with the reverse for monitor 2.

SUPER+ESCAPE binding: ESCAPE is passed to the app when it shouldn't

### How to reproduce

1. Add to config:
```
binds {
    workspace_back_and_forth = yes
    allow_workspace_cycles = yes
}
```
2. Create binding: `bind = SUPER, ESCAPE, workspace, previous`
3. Run Firefox, open Youtube, start playing any video, make it fullscreen.
4. Switch to any other workspace,
5. Press SUPER+ESCAPE to get back to the workspace with fullscreen video.

The video is not fullscreen anymore, because SUPER+ESCAPE works when pressing ESCAPE button, but Firefox is obviously receiving ESCAPE release button event. I think Firefox should not consume ESCAPE in this case.

1590,Fullscreen video crashes hyprland," is on NixOS, I'll tag @fufexan as well.

I am using echo360 for watching my university lectures. Whenever I fullscreen the video, after a while (say 5 mins) the screen goes black. Moving the mouse brings it back, but I am unable to do anything to that video anymore.
The keyboard inputs work for pausing/playing the video, but pressing esc does not do anything. It feels like a single screen (like cage) and does not accept mouse input or anything. Switching to another tty is possible, but that's it. There's no way to get back into the hyprland session except issuing a restart command from another tty.
This has occurred every single time, as I can reproduce it. It does not happen with youtube videos tho (at least I haven't experienced that. I think that it disconnects the monitor when the screen goes black, but I am not sure.

887,Hyprland regression on 7a0a5666d565a3ef892a7ab433a5007dd1cc72dd crash on launch,"

Hyprland crashes on launch with no apparent error in logs. I have git bisected and it first appears on commit 7a0a5666d565a3ef892a7ab433a5007dd1cc72dd, the exact previous commit(1778fb77e20a7ff0c9fc20bb139b2e63fa41c7ef) launches successfully

2228,Pointer constraints being immediately removed after creation on native Wayland windows,"land-native application (in my case, [Looking Glass](https://looking-glass.io/)) attempts to constrain the mouse, the constraint seems to be removed immediately on moving the mouse. Hyprland logs while attempting to reproduce this show the following:
```
[LOG] New mouse constraint at 25006c0
[LOG] Registered signal for owner 25067d0: 25007c8 -> 2506848 (owner: Constraint)
[LOG] Registered signal for owner 25067d0: 25007b8 -> 25067e0 (owner: Constraint)
[LOG] Constraint rechecked: 0, 0 to 1169, 609 for 2450050 (window name: )
[LOG] Registered signal for owner 1e584e0: 2450310 -> 1e58538 (owner: Mouse constraint commit)
[LOG] Constrained mouse to 25006c0
<move mouse here>
[LOG] Callback 1e58560 -> 1e58558, Mouse constraint commit removed.
```

Based on that final log message, it appears to me as if [this call to `unconstrainMouse`](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/src/managers/input/InputManager.cpp#L78) is being fired before it should, especially since it isn't accompanied by a `[LOG] Unconstrained mouse from <id>` message that I observed when testing similar functionality in Minecraft, which uses XWayland.

Reproduction might be tricky for this one, as Looking Glass requires a whole host of complicated VM and PCI passthrough setup to get working, and I'm unaware of any other Wayland-native apps with similar mouse capturing behaviour. although according to #536, SDL applications seem to be exhibiting similar behaviour, so that could be another way to test this. I'm unaware of any SDL apps that try to grab the pointer off the top of my head though. In any case, reproduction should look something like:

1. Open a Wayland-native application that tries to grab the cursor
2. Try to move the mouse outside of the window

Expected: The mouse cannot be moved outside the window.
Actual: The mouse moves outside the window",0

Switching workspaces with a sliding animation, the windows on the 'old' workspace become invisible during the animation if the 'new' workspace has a fullscreen window.

### How to reproduce

Open a window on a workspace and fullscreen it.
switch to another workspace and open some windows there.
Now while switching to the fullscreen worskpace, the windows on the second workspace are not visible while the fullscreen workspace slides in.

56,"bind sometimes not ""releasing"" SUPER key","

The bug happens when I press SUPER to change workspace sometimes it appears it's not released and the focus window receives the SUPER key with any keys until I press SUPER again.

### How to reproduce

To make the bug happens (not systematic)
For example:
1. Be at workspace 1
2. Holding SUPER
3. Press backspace (it's my workspace previous mapping but I made it bug without previous too)
5. Type a
6. The focus window receive <D-a>(SUPER+a) instead of just a

I can't make it systematic but it happens quite often.
I noticed that pressing ANY modifier key remove the bug

I have installed hyprland from pacman(sudo pacman -S hyprland). Please tell some solution. How get logs information as screen turns black nothing opens and I have to shutdown forcefully by button.

562,Incorrect resolution when hyprland started inside hyprland,"

When I started Hyprland inside Hyprland and main Scale factor is not equals 1.0. Resolution of inner Hyprland depends on scale factor. 

For example: 3840p host and 1.875 scale, guest Hyprland has 2048x1152 resolution instead of 3840. 

I  use nested Hyprland to start Hyprland with different XWAYLAND_NO_GLAMOR option. I need to set up this option to 0 in main session and to 1 in nested session. 

### How to reproduce

Start Hyprland inside Hyprland with Scale factor

273,Modifier keys not working on some keys,"

Modifier keys do not work with some keys, specifically the < and ' keys. 
I am using a Finnish layout pc105 keyboard, and this bug is hardware-specific, verified that all works as expected (no bugs) on another Finnish pc105 layout keyboard.
Specific keyboard model: Kingston HyperX Alloy FPS Mechanical Gaming Keyboard
Attaching a part of a wev log that shows what happens in Hyprland, essentially, the modifier keys show normal pressed events, but when the < or ' keys are pressed with the modifier key, the modifier key does not show up as pressed despite there not being an event to lift the modifier key.
This behavior seems to happen only in Hyprland (although I would love to test this in more environments to help debug this), as Sway does not have this issue (at least for me). I have however encountered similar behavior in Fedora KDE, although there this only seemed to effect qt-based applications. 
This bug currently makes Hyprland effectively unusable for me, as I cannot type '*', '|', or '>', which are rather inconvenient symbols to be missing while using the terminal.

### How to reproduce

Plug my keyboard in (bug is hardware-specific xd)
Open a terminal in Hyprland
Press shift + <
Expected behavior: A '*' character appears
Observed behavior: A '<' character appears

1249,`WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE` Now Needed to Startup and Phantom Display Detected ,"

The environment variable `WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1` needs to be set for startup with Nvidia graphics, as the latest version changes something that now necessitate this variable, where it was not necessary before (version  0.28.0-1). Hyprland is able to launch with it, whereas it immediately segfaults without it upon attempting to launch, stating that it is unable to initialize EGL. After updating to the latest version of Hyprland and setting the variable, a ""phantom"" display labeled as ""Unknown-1"" is detected. This display is not physically connected and does not appear when the environment variable is unset or when using an older version of Hyprland where the variable was not necessary.

### How to reproduce

## Unable to Start
1. Update to the latest version of Hyprland.
2. Ensure WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE is not set.
3. Start Hyprland (I start from TTY with `Hyprland`).
4. Observe immediate crash and segfault, with message mentioning inability to initialize EGL.

## Phantom Display
1. Update to the latest version of Hyprland.
2. Set the environment variable WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE to 1 in the Hyprland environment variables configuration.
3. Start Hyprland (I start from TTY with `Hyprland`).
4. Use the `hyprctl monitors` command to list connected displays.
5. Observe an additional display labeled ""Unknown-1"" that is not physically connected.

`hyprctl dispatch dpms on` turns the display back on
## Noted outcome

293,Steam notifications appearing in wrong place,"

I have two monitors, one at 2560x1440 and one at 1920x1080.

On the version of Hyprland stated above, when steam notifications appear on the larger monitor, they appear inset from the edge, as if they think they're on the 1080 monitor.

On the release version of Hyprland...

Hyprland, built from branch  at commit 9654749244117f7f150c6f2a2ce4dede6e8cbb25 dirty (). Tag: v0.28.0#

all steam notifications appear on the smaller monitor, regardless of which is focused or where steam is.

On the version of Hyprland I *previously* had installed...

Hyprland, built from branch main at commit 7395987 dirty (remove shadow no_gaps_when_only (2956)). Tag: v0.28.0-36-g73959871

I *believe* the notifications apeared where they were supposed to. But I am honestly not 100% certain of that. I just don't *recall* noticing a problem.

If I disable the smaller monitor, notifications appear correctly. This persists even after I re-enable the second monitor.

But executing:

`hyprctl keyword monitor HDMI-A-2,disable`

and then:

`hyprctl keyword monitor HDMI-A-2,preferred,2560x1440,auto`

after starting Hyprland, as a workaround, makes it so that I can't move my mouse between monitors.

My monitors are configured as:

```
monitor=DP-2, preferred, 0x0, auto
monitor=HDMI-A-2, preferred, 2560x0, auto
```







### How to reproduce

I don't know exactly what is affecting this, whether the monitor connections (DP vs. HDMI) matter, but:

* Have two monitors of different sizes (larger one may need to be > 1080)
* Focus the larger monitor
* Cause a steam notification (download a small game)

942,Sigabort with the sub-command `setcursors`,"

I wanted to investigate why `hyprland` wasn't using the cursor theme configured in `gsettings`.

By looking to similar issue on the internet, stumble upon this reddit discussion:

> `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme Adwaita` do this, 
> alongside with `hyprctl setcursor`, and `lxappearance`. I made my own """"[script](https://github.com/EuCaue/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/cursor.fish)"""" to do this.

> 
> https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/zrvp78/comment/j163s5n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

So I've tried the command `hyprctl setcursor`.

### How to reproduce

My current cursor theme is `Nordzy-cursors` (I used the same value returned by `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme` minus the single-quote).

So I used that value in the following command 

```shell
hyprctl setcursor Nordzy-cursors
```

And `hyprland` abort just after (I've tried 2 time and it abort at each).

135,Tracking the size of Xwayland windows seems broken,"

[Wezterm has an issue](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/4483) that's causing it to disable Wayland support [to keep working on Hyprland after 59f27e7](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/59f27e7f570170783ac01fb46a0ff90e14de53e6)

As a side effect of the fix, increasing the font size of the wezterm window (pressing Ctrl +) makes it render outside the window shown in Hyprland.

If fullscreen is bound to F12 with `bind = , F12, fullscreen`, pressing on F12 twice fixes the window.

Since doing fullscreen twice may refresh the window geometry, maybe hyprland doesn't keep track of the Xwayland windows geometry updates? That'd be necessary to render them properly.

A similar bug can be seen with Microsoft Edge, where the mouse events are not mapped to the correct coordinates until after F12 is pressed twice.

Edge worked fine without having to do F12, so it may be a regression linked to window size tracking


### How to reproduce

Start wezterm with `enable_wayland = false` then press `Ctrl +` a few times until you can't see your prompt or wezterm tab bar

Press twice the key you've bound to fullscreen, you'll see wezterm tab bar and prompt again

I'm using the following options in hyrland.conf, which may be needed to reproduce the issue:

```
monitor=,highres,auto,1.5

  force_zero_scaling = true

132,"Multiple GPU's Not Working when GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm is set (not a laptop, displays connected to both integrated and discrete GPU's)","

I am on archcraft using `hyprland-git`, and I am using a somewhat odd setup: I have an intel iGPU with one monitor plugged into it, and I have an nvidia 980 Ti with two monitors plugged into it. 

My nvidia drivers are the dkms version, installed using the ""frogging family"" installer, and everything seems to work just fine except when trying to enable all the nvidia parameters. I've narrowed it down to it being the `GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm` env variable, as commenting out all other variables in my config and just having the nvidia variables from the readme (and commenting out the `GBM_BACKEND` line) lets hyprland start. But it's laggy as hell and only barely passes the mark of being useable.

Judging by the output of the log, I'm assuming that it is trying to assign the nvidia-drm to the intel GPU as well, as it mentions a ""bad parameter"" and an incorrect number of variables being passed. I do not have this issue on other desktop environments/window managers that are wayland based.

### How to reproduce

- Have a monitor plugged into both the iGPU and the dedicated GPU (intel, nvidia, respectively)
- Enable the `GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm` env variable
- - Hyprland crashes on startup back to login manager

I was setting up my various applications to work on Hyprland when I noticed that Emacs and Lxappearence aren't displayed, even though every other program seem to work just fine.

I initially thought that this issue was caused by some GTK incompatibility but, since PCManFM gets correctly rendered, I traced the problem back to XWayland, noting that both Emacs and Lxappearance don't have native Wayland support.

So I tried to launch `xprop -name lxappearance` to check whether the server was working or not, and I found out that, even if the window is correctly recognized by XProp, Hyprland somehow fails to render it.

I checked in the logs for errors related to XWayland, but it seems that nothing useful is recorded in there (maybe besides ""null"" notated as the class name for the XWayland window):

232,idleinhibit windowrule not working,"

After adding the windowrule:

`windowrulev2 = idleinhibit focus,class:(org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser)
`
(or any other mode for idleinhibit, including non existent modes (which btw doesn't raise any errors))

nothing keeps swayidle from firing after given timeout.

Setting a different rule like 'dimaround' for testing works.

### How to reproduce

add the above mentionend windowrule for whatever window class or title:

`windowrulev2 = idleinhibit focus,class:([window])`

set your idle handler (in my case swayidle) to a short timeout for testing:

`swayidle -w timeout 5 [your_lock_command]`

1440,Perfomance issues when using Hyprland.,"s really weird issue, when using Hyprland...
I've installed Hyprland on top of an existing Arch-Installation with Gnome using Wayland. When using Gnome, everything seems to work fine, animations are smooth, no stutters whatsoever...

But using Hyprland gives me really bad performance, even on workspace/window animations, games are even worse. 

I've found multiple articles covering these issues, but all of them where nVidia related, none of them covered Intels iGPU's. 

Anyone having an idea? Or hints for debugging the issue?

The config file entry background_color in the category misc does not work.

There is a decent change i am an idiot and i messed something up; but i can't seem to figure out what. I tried to verify if my build from source actually installed properly, but i did a stupid and forgot to write down the output of hyprctl version beforehand.

1033,Focus issues with GTK and QT tooltips/menus,"

I have updated hyprland on my system the other day to get the fix for new windows not being focused when switching workspaces and I started to notice that quite often the window I am working on completely stopped responding to mouse clicks until I either switch focus to another window and back or just move my mouse to the waybar and back. #3553 sounds similar but I am not sure if it's the same issue.

After some digging I have figured out the following about the issue:
* only seems to be a problem with GTK and QT apps running in wayland (not xwayland)
* QT: if you pause the mouse cursor on something to get a tooltip and then move the mouse over that tooltip then the whole window will be locked (the border will indicate that it is still focused). Tested with qutebrowser and digikam
* GTK: if you open any context menu then the background window will be locked (you will not be able to close the menu by clicking outside of it). Also moving the mouse around the menu reveals that you can actually select and click stuff withing it while having the mouse outside the menu which seems to be similar to #3553. Tooltips don't seem to be an issue as they are with QT apps. Tested with firefox and seahorse (passwords and keys app).
* stuff running in xwayland seem to behave fine. Tested with Brave
all of the above is 100% repro rate for me

Some things I have not figured out yet:
* Opening new apps that are not the only thing on the workspace seems to have similar issues as I have noticed that the border indicates the right one is focused but when I click with the mouse then the clicks happen on the left window. Not sure on GTK vs QT combos here.
* I've also noticed that sometimes I can't select text in alacritty.

I am running with Nvidia GPU so not sure if that will be the cause.
I have tried both `hyprland-nvidia-git` and `hyprland-git` from AUR and both are the same for me.
I have installed `hyprland` from the core arch repos which is version 0.30 and that one doesn't lock up windows. It does have that weird offset mouse clicks with context menus with GTK apps that I've described above though.

These env variables don't seem to make any difference from what I've seen
```
GDK_BACKEND,wayland,x11    
QT_QPA_PLATFORM,wayland;xcb
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,qt5ct
```

Let me know if you need any more info

### How to reproduce

0. Edit hyprland.conf to only include the following
```
env = GDK_BACKEND,wayland,x11     # GTK: Use wayland if available, fall back to x11 if not.
env = QT_QPA_PLATFORM,wayland;xcb # QT: Use wayland if available, fall back to x11 if not.
env = QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,qt5ct  # Tells QT based applications to pick your theme from qt5ct, use with Kvantum.

input {
    follow_mouse = 0
}
```

QT
1. open qutebrowser running in wayland
2. go to https://wiki.hyprland.org/
3. hover the mouse either on the git or the darkmode icon on the right until a tooltip appears
4. quickly move the mouse over the tooltip without the cursor leaving the window
5. try clicking anything in the window to notice that no clicks are registered (not even the browser tabs)

GTK
1. open firefox running in wayland
6. click on the hamburger menu on the right
7. move the mouse to the left of it and notice that as you move the mouse around items in the menu get highlighted (imagine the context menu was positioned at the top left corner of the firefox window and you would be able to interract with it - in other words it is active in 2 places on the screen and only displayed in it's correct position)
8. try clicking something in firefox outside the context menu and notice that it has no effect

1054,Floating focused window does not go to the top of the stack,"

Floating window does not go to the top of the stack on keyboard focus and needs to be clicked with the mouse, this is especially annoying when the focused window is completely covered with another floating window, so you have to move/resize the bigger window to click the window you want to focus..
I am aware of the `alterzorder` and `bringactivetotop` dispatchers, and plan on using one of them as workaround for the time being, but I really do believe that bringing active to top should be default behaviour, or a variable to be toggled.

### How to reproduce

- create 2 floating windows.
- overlap them.
- move focus between the 2 (im using cyclenext binded on alt tab).

expected behaviour:
 focused window covers all other.
actual behaviour:
 focused window stays covered by other window.

Hyprland starts correctly both from SDDM and with the wrapper script with appropriate NVIDIA exports.

It seems related to [this](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/934#issuecomment-406902581) wlroots issue, but that was closed in 2018, and Hyprland uses very recent wlroots builds.
It might also be related to [this](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/issues/3451) more recent wlroots issue. 

This issue does not occur on a clean install of Wayfire, which is also based on wlroots",0
1579,Allow switching to a window in a dwindle group via wlr-foreign-toplevel-management,"eproduce:

0. Install [rofi-lbonn-wayland-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rofi-lbonn-wayland-git)
1. Make a dwindle group with two windows
2. Run `rofi -show window`
3. Try to switch to a window that is not currently active in the group.
4. Observe that the switch fails.

This also happens with `misc:focus_on_activate = true` on opening an URL from another app when firefox is in a dwindle group (in this case an urgency hint is set instead).

However, `hyprctl dispatch focus` is able to switch to the same window.

1936,Waybar doesn't display workspace names ,"lowed the instructions in the Waybar section at https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/Status-Bars/
I built https://github.com/Alexays/waybar from source with the commands shown in the wiki. 
I have also tried https://github.com/r-clifford/Waybar-Hyprland which doesn't fix the issue.

to reproduce: start Hyprland, for this, I use the command `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland dbus-run-session Hyprland`. To start waybar I use: `exec-once = waybar &` in `hyprland.conf`

Expected outcome: Waybar shows workspaces with their names

noted outcome: Waybar doesn't show workspaces with their names

964,Resizing on up/down it resizes (slightly) on left/right,"

Hyprland keybindings (submap) resizes wrong, kindly see the video 

### How to reproduce


add this in the default config
```
# resize submap
bind=$mainMod SHIFT_L,R,submap,resize

submap=resize

binde=,l,resizeactive,10 0
binde=,h,resizeactive,-10 0
binde=,k,resizeactive,0 -10
binde=,j,resizeactive,0 10

bind=,escape,submap,reset 

submap=reset
```

do as i did in the video
1. open two windows
2. resize one window to right side
3. goto resize mode
4. now press resize keys for up/down

441,White flickering on the right side of the screen with Chromium,"o reproduce

1. Open Chromium
2. Watch a video 
3. Switch to another workspace
4. Switch back

## Expected outcome
Nothing on the right side of the screen

## Noted outcome
White flickering on the right side of the screen.

- Toggling full screen fixes it temporarily
- Trying to take a screenshot fixes it temporarily :(

2556,Small issue in workspace numbering/switching when special workspace present," the bug**
Kind of one feature and one bug. 

1) When creating a special workspace (by sending a window to it), the workspace can be swicthed to when using workspace,+1 or -1. It appears at the end, both the lower end (workspace,-1 when on the lowest numeric workspace) or at the upper end (when doing workspace,+1 from the highest numerical ws). Nothing really wrong with the special WS being visible/switchable to (was that a design choice? why?), but it being visible from both end looks weird.
2) when switching to the special WS, and back (again using workspace,+1 or -1), it skips the first WS it encounter. That is, say I have WS 1 and 2. I send a window to the special WS, thus creating it. 
then I go workspace,+1 several time: the WS go 1,2,special. 
If now I go workspace,-1 several time, what it does is: 1,special. It skips 2.
Same if I start from the bottom and go up, it goes (from special): 2, special - it skips 1.

I guess that's a bug.

1602,layer shell keyboard mode ON_DEMAND not working with v4,"

I'm playing around with GTK4 on wayland, trying to implement a simple panel in python.
I'm using the GTK4-layer-shell from https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell.
I'm not an expert, but apparently there are different keyboard modes in the layer shell protocol: `NONE`, `EXCLUSIVE` and `ON_DEMAND`. none means a window should never grab focus, exclusive means a window should always get the focus, and on_demand is like it should get the focus when needed (?). I first mentioned this problem here: https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell/issues/19

In my example, I have a button on the panel that opens a popover (like an application menu) with an input field.
The problem on hyprland is:
- with KeyboardMode.NONE, the input cannot receive focus
- with KeyboardMode.EXCLUSIVE, no other window can receive focus
- with KeyboardMode.ON_DEMAND, it is the same as with EXCLUSIVE, even though I expected that to work.

The expected behavior is that when I click the button, the popover opens, and the input field should get the keyboard focus, or at least I should be able to focus it by clicking. However when clicking outside the popover should close and I should be able to interact with the normal windows.

Here is a simple code snippet to reproduce (requires gtk4-layer-shell to be installed):
```python
from ctypes import CDLL
CDLL('libgtk4-layer-shell.so')

import gi
gi.require_version(""Gtk"", ""4.0"")
gi.require_version('Gtk4LayerShell', '1.0')
from gi.repository import Gtk, Gtk4LayerShell as LayerShell

def on_activate(app):
    win = Gtk.ApplicationWindow(application=app)

    LayerShell.init_for_window(win)
    LayerShell.set_layer(win, LayerShell.Layer.TOP)
    LayerShell.auto_exclusive_zone_enable(win)
    LayerShell.set_anchor(win, LayerShell.Edge.TOP, True)
    LayerShell.set_keyboard_mode(win, LayerShell.KeyboardMode.ON_DEMAND)
    
    root = Gtk.Box()
    win.set_child(root)
    button = Gtk.Button(label=""click me"")
    root.append(button)
    def close(*args):
        app.quit()
    popover = Gtk.Popover()
    box = Gtk.Box()
    input = Gtk.Text(placeholder_text='placeholder text')
    button2 = Gtk.Button(label='close')
    button2.connect('clicked', close)
    box.append(input)
    box.append(button2)
    popover.set_child(box)
    popover.set_parent(button)

    def clicked(*args):
        popover.popup()
    button.connect('clicked', clicked)

    win.present()
    
app = Gtk.Application(application_id='org.gtk.Example')
app.connect('activate', on_activate)
app.run(None)

602,Mouse Click Accuracy Degraded After Upgrading to 0.35,"

When clicking to place the cursor in text or to highlight text, the cursor is consistently inaccurate by at least on character, as seen in the video linked here. https://imgur.com/a/GA2ErZD  

On the first part of the video, I clicked on the right side of the ""p"" yet the highlight started on the left side. In the second attempt, I clicked on the right side of the ""e"" and it started the highlight on the left. 

This happens in both Vivaldi, Discord, and Zimwiki. At first I thought it would be because of Chrome/Electron whatever, but Zim is not an electron app. 

Sorry if this isn't a good explanation of what's happening, unsure how to explain it better. It's very annoying as it feels as if the mouse clicks are happening slightly to the left of where I want them to be.

Using openSUSE tumbleweed, with hyprland built from source. 

### How to reproduce

Unsure, other than to click on things.

95,Screen display updates only a partial region matching smaller secondary output,"

I currently have two outputs, one 1920x1080 and the other 1440x900. Occasionally, seemingly randomly because I haven't worked out the steps to reproduce it yet, the 1920x1080 output (the primary one) will begin updating only a seemingly 1440x900 region of the screen starting from the top left corner. A bar along the right and bottom of the screen will become 'stuck'.
Fortunately I have discovered that simply opening and closing a terminal on the output will resolve the issue (I assume it forces a redraw of some kind).

The issue has been present for several weeks now (I build master daily), I'd attempt a bisection but without being able to reproduce it, and with it being as rare as it is, I am unable to at this time. Hopefully someone else has more information.

### How to reproduce

No known way to reproduce at this time.

2614,Windows randomly stop accepting keyboard input," the bug**

Open windows will stop accepting keyboard input at random, typically just after interacting with the window by mouse. It will remain impossible to send any keypresses to the window (typed input, hotkeys, etc.) until focus is shifted to another window or workspace, then back to the problem window. 

This most commonly occurs in browsers (brave) and terminal windows (kitty, foot). I cannot reliably recreate this issue, but it pops up every minute or two in Brave, typically while interacting with a browser extension.

1746,Mouse isn't properly separated from keyboard focus,"times switches to where the mouse currently is even if `follow_mouse = 3` is set. 

Steps to reproduce (Variant 1):
1. Have 2 monitors with a window open on each one
2. Place mouse cursor over the window on the right monitor and keyboard focus on the left monitor
3. Close the window on the left monitor
4. Focus is now on the right monitor

Expected outcome:
Focus stays on the left screen and I can open the next window there.

Noted outcome:
Focus switches to the right monitor and new window will be opened there.


Steps to reproduce (Variant 2):
1. Have multiple windows opened
2. Have mouse cursor and keyboard cursor on different windows
3. Launch Conky
4. Focus is now on the window with a cursor

Expected outcome:
Focus doesn't change.

Noted outcome:
Focus changes.

Steps to reproduce (Variant 3, the most annoying):
1. Have 2 monitors
2. Have windows open on monitor 1 but not on monitor 2
3. Move mouse over any of the windows on monitor 1

824,Can't use windowrulev2 for automatically centering floating windows,"

I've been trying to configure Hyprland to automatically center floating windows. From the docs it seems like I should be able to achieve this with a window rule like `windowrulev2 = center, floating:1`, but that's not working.

I managed to achieve this by using the following binding to combine both dispatchers:
```
bind = SUPER, F, exec, hyprctl --batch ""dispatch togglefloating ; dispatch centerwindow""
```
Although that works when using the binding, I wonder if there's a better way workaround...

### How to reproduce

Add the following to your Hyprland configuration:
```
bind = SUPER, F, togglefloating
windowrulev2 = center, floating:1
```

Toggle the floating status of a window using the `SUPER + F` mapping above. Notice how the floating window isn't automatically centered.

1927,Tabbed windows disappears if layout is changed from dwindle to master,"eproduce:

1. Use dwindle layout
2. Group some windows
3. Change from dwindle to master while having tabbed/grouped windows
4. Only the one on top will be visible and accessible afterwards.
5. Does not become accessible if change back to dwindle layout

Expected outcome:
Grouped windows being dispersed when layout is changed to prevent this behavior.

Noted outcome:
Windows not on top of the group goes to aether but can still be seen in `hyprctl client` list, seems not to be possible to focus or bring to top with hyprctl

Noticed this when I made a simple bash script to change the layout with hyprctl

LAYOUT=$(hyprctl getoption general:layout dwindle | grep -o dwindle)
if [[ $LAYOUT == ""dwindle"" ]]; then
    	hyprctl keyword general:layout master
    else
    	hyprctl keyword general:layout dwindle

Then tested changing the configuration in the file, same outcome.

1. Set up a dual monitor configuration in Hyprland with the following settings:

    ```
    monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,860x1440,1
    monitor=desc:Samsung Electric Company C34J79x HTRMA00910,3440x1440@100,0x0,1
    ```
I have a laptop monitor below, and a bigger monitor above. (Notice the location 860x1440) 

2. I have experimented with the following window rules for `terminal.exe` running through Wine:
   terminal.exe is the MetaTrader4 application, used for forex trading.

    ```
    windowrulev2 = float,class:^(terminal.exe)$
    windowrulev2 = nomaxsize,class:^(terminal.exe)$
    windowrulev2 = center,class:^(terminal.exe)$
    ```

4. Disconnect the external monitor.

5. Start `terminal.exe` through Wine.

**Expected outcome**:

The `terminal.exe` window should open in the center of the screen and stay there, as specified by the `center` window rule.

**Noted outcome**:

The `terminal.exe` window initially opens in the center of the screen, but then suddenly moves to position 0,19. The output from `hyprctl clients`:

```

If i change monitor setting from:
    ```
    monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,860x1440,1
    ```
to:
    ```
    monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1
    ```
Then i will see the window that is located at 0,19, and i can move it around etc as normal.

Suspect the issue here is in the interaction between hyprland and some wine setting.

864,Grimblast Selecting Window Behind Fullscreen,"

When there are two or more windows on a screen, even after setting one of those to fullscreen, grimblast still highlights and let's me select the other panes.

If I try to take a screenshot of those, nothing comes out, which makes sense since they are occluded, but I do not think grimblast should be able to select those windows in the first place.

In a screen, create at least two windows. Set one of those windows to fullscreen. Then, use grimblast and move your mouse on top of where the non-fullscreen panel should be. The window should be highlighted by grimblast.

2421,File-Pickers don't work in Chromium browsers.,"Hyprland on NixOS alongside Sway WM and GNOME as a Desktop Environment. 

As the issue suggests, when I'm in Hyprland, Chromium browsers are not giving me any kind of file-picker window for uploading local files in the browser.  All browsers give a file-picker in GNOME and Sway, though I've noticed that the file-picker Firefox uses is different than what the Chromium browsers use. The Firefox file-picker works as expected in Hyprland.

- **Steps to reproduce**:
    - Install a chromium browser (Brave, Google Chrome, ungoogled-chromium)
    - Attempt to upload a file from the local disk in one of those browsers
    - Eg. Add a file to a Bug Report on Github; Add an attachment in Gmail; Upload an assignment file in Moodle (learning mangagement platform) 
- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Clicking the Upload/Browse/Choose File link will open a file picker window.
- **Noted Outcome**:
    - No file-picker opens.

I'm not sure if `bug` is the best label here, but I wasn't sure how else to characterize it.

1747,Custom XKB layout not working as expected,"
Yesterday I installed Hyprland On my PPP, but I've been running into a keyboard issue that I did not experience on phosh (gnome).

I got my preferred keyboard [layout](https://codeberg.org/phalio/ppkb-layouts/commit/5bdbd65da92993bbc770d008b7d314c4758899cb) from [here](https://codeberg.org/phalio/ppkb-layouts/) and selected it via `xkb_layout=pp` and `xkb_variant=default-de-sprinkles` but weirdly enough, the entire keyboard does no longer output anything. I can still use the arrow keys, tab, enter and escape in fuzzel. Hyprland still picks up all keypresses with a binding.

1484,Master Layout unwanted gap when using vertical bar + center orientation," this issue was partially fixed after #1171, but only for specific orientations. I am currently seeing the same issue, but for `orientation=center`.

I am on a 32:9 monitor, so having a vertical bar + center orientation is a key part of my setup. I solved this issue on i3 by making the bar only visible on hover and take up no actual WM space, but I would much prefer to make this work without the gap because the alternative approach has its own inconveniences.

## Steps to reproduce
- Enable Master layout with orientation of center
```
general {
  layout=master
}
master {
  orientation=center
}
```
- Set up vertical bar (I personally am using Eww)
- Populate windows (master + clients)

## Expected Behavior
- No increased gaps between windows
- Master window not pushed too far to the right

## Actual Behavior
- Master window pushed too far to the right and overlapping with some client windows

1439,Poor Yuzu Performance on Hyprland - Not on Sway,"ng any games through Yuzu on Hyprland, performance is extremely poor.  Switching to Sway resolves this.
(I have previously run Yuzu through GNOME and got similar results to Sway)

My Setup:
- NixOS - [Config Here](https://github.com/A1029384756/nix-config)
- Hyprland from the Flake
- ASUS Zephyrus G14 - 2021
- Yuzu 1484 (Flatpak) (NVIDIA Vulkan)

### Steps to Reproduce
Run any Yuzu game

### FPS Comparison (In Menu)
- Hyprland => 8-14
- Sway => 60 (capped)

### Observations
When comparing Hyprland and Sway, the microprofile traces from Yuzu yielded vastly different results. One major observation was that the ""Copy to Swapchain"" step was taking drastically longer on the Hyprland side. For the most part, the ""Execute Command Buffer"" step remained unchanged between the two.  The other was that the frametimes were seemingly much less consistent on Hyprland's end.

786,monitor settings cause kernel panic (NVIDIA drivers),"

Using the `highres` or `highrr` settings in my Hyprland configuration crash the kernel. I was able to consistently reproduce this using the latest `6.1.68-1-lts` kernel on EndeavourOS with the following `nvidia-dkms` drivers:

- 545.29.06
- 535.113.01
- 530.41.03
- 525.89.02
- 520.56.06
- 515.76 

See the logs attached for the logs and system settings.

Workaround:

- Configure the monitor in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` with `monitor=,preferred,auto,auto`
- Use `exec-once = wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --mode 7680x2160@119.997002Hz --scale 2` instead

### How to reproduce

- Use a monitor with high resolution and refresh capabilities
- Use a relatively recent NVIDIA graphics card that can drive the monitor
- Install Arch
- Install Hyprland (use something like https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots that configures everything correctly)
- Reboot to verify that everything is working on stock settings
- Configure the monitor in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` with `monitor=,highres,auto,1`
- Hyprland will switch to the new monitor settings without issues (in my case to 7680x2160@120Hz)
- Reboot the system
- Kernel panic after logging into the system

459,CPU usage 100% attaching bash script to socket2 with exec-once,"be the bug

When attaching a bash script to the socket2 with the `exec-once` functionality, the CPU usage of Hyprland goes to 100% afterwards till the attached script is killed.

Running the bash script over the terminal is not causing any CPU problems.

### Steps to reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add to the `hyprland.conf`
    ```
    exec-once = ~/.config/hypr/attach
    ```
2. Create the `~/.config/hypr/attach` script and make it executable. The script is from the [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Expanding-functionality/) but `socat -t 1000` was added according to #1089 to survive the startup phase of Hyprland.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh

    function handle {
      if [[ ${1:0:10} == ""focusedmon"" ]]; then
        if [[ ${1:12:4} == ""DP-1"" ]]; then
          hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out 20
        else
          hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out 30
        fi
      fi
    }

    socat -t 1000 - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/$(echo $HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE)/.socket2.sock | while read line; do handle $line; done
    ```
3. Log out and in again (restarting Hyprland)
4. CPU usage is at 100% for the process `Hyprland` till you kill the attached script, e.g. `pkill attach`

### Expected outcome

CPU usage should not be affected.

I'm running EndeavourOS and i use yay instead of paru.

Hyprland crashes on boot since commit 8c9f38e40500720d4de5881d62ec43625e9680ea
Reverting to c0d9dcc586ab17bf67c48c02a08bca28727f9237 fixes the issue

2253,VRAM and RAM Memory Leak on config reload,"reproduce

1. To monitor memory usage open `nvtop` (displays both RAM and VRAM) or run `watch -n 1 -d nvidia-smi` (VRAM only).

2. Run `hyprctl reload` few times

## Expected behavior

VRAM / RAM usage +- stays at the level it was.

## Actual behavior

After about 20 reloads VRAM peaks at about max capacity.
Further reloads don't increase usage, but it never decreases on its own.

Here is how it looks in `nvtop`:

## System

* Arch Linux latest
* linux-zen 5.19.13
* nvidia-dkms 515.76-1 ([Instructions](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/) from the wiki applied except fixes for flickering)
* Hyprland 0.15.1beta, generated config + few bindings, nothing fancy

2469,VRAM Memory Leak on window close," reproduce
   * Launch terminal with `watch -n 1 -d nvidia-smi`
   * Launch 2 new kitty instances (or any other terminal) and then close them
* Expected outcome
   * The VRAM usage should decrease after closing the instances
* Noted outcome
   * The VRAM usage instead increases, this happens until your GPU runs out of VRAM, freezes and you have to kill Hyprland for it to release the memory.

While I know NVIDIA support isn't directly there, it's more a question for how to properly fix this as I don't use Discord. A reset was also performed, without making any difference.
Tried `nvidia-open`, `nvidia` and `nvidia-lts` drivers (both DKMS and non), all ending in the same memory leak.

I've also tried to disable things like blur, which also didn't reduce the leaks. This is using the standard-generated config with changed keybindings and `exec-once=dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` added at the bottom",0

480,dragging tabs to split inside pycharm fails,"rland! thank you so much for your efforts, 
I'm starting to use this as a daily driver and am having minimal issues, but just noticed this 


Steps to reproduce:
- Open pycharm
- Open project
- Open two files
- Drag tab to right hand side to split window vertically (within pycharm)


Expected outcome:
- pycharm should split the the files, one left, one right

Noted outcome:
- when dragging the tabs, it automatically drops the tab focus, and it splits horizontally inside pycharm


Happy to provide any logs requested.
Note there is a work around, right clicking on a tab and spiting that way does work, so not a huge issue.


installed versions if this helps:
pycharm-professional 2022.2.1-1
hyprland 0.18.0beta-1

2025,4k Monitor not recognized in-game,": 4K Monitor is not recognized in-game (all-games) - Highest resolution monitor available is 2560x1440.

Config file monitor is set to: Monitor=DP-1, 3840x2160@144,0x0,1.5 and the general TWM respects this. As neofetch outputs the correct 3840x2160p.

Steps to reproduce: Load any game on Steam, or through a respective launcher. ie Minecraft Launcher

Expected outcome: Game should be either be in 4k (3840x2160) or in the video settings of said game; There should be the option to switch to 4k(3840x2160).

Noted outcome: Games launched only have 2560x1440 as the highest available resolution.

This bug does NOT crash hyprland. But seems like invalid behavior.

### What was observed?

Hyprland used to run after the Mesa update was fixed (yes there was a bug report but that was on openSUSE Mesa and it got fixed). I am currently running on RiverWM to check if I can run Hyprland in a tty but same error.",0

Failed (seems segfault) to start under xfce4 session

### How to reproduce

Run xfce4 session, install `hyprland` package, run `Hyprland` from terminal emulator

1852,`movecurrentworkspacetomonitor` on monitor's last workspace causes invalid state," reproduce**
1. Create workspaces on at least two monitors.
2. Move the last workspace on one of the monitors to the other monitor.

**Expected outcome**
A new (empty) workspace is created on the first monitor.

**Noted outcome**
The window move animation plays on the first monitor, and the workspace appears on the second monitor, but the windows aren't rendered. The output of `hyprctl workspaces` and the `wlr-workspaces` module of waybar both list no workspaces associated with the first monitor.
Also, the binds I've mapped to switching between workspaces by number don't work until I focus the first monitor (with my mouse) and create a new workspace there (by moving to it)",0

2581,Hyprland Segfault when toomany windows are opened," the bug**
I opened many windows open in one workspace and then try to close them and Hyprland crashes.
I have so many windows open that the border color is no longer visible or the new windows.


Please attach a log (it's in /tmp/hypr/hyprland.log) and, if crashing, a crashdump (coredumpctl, then coredumpctl info <pid>)

241,Core dump after layout changes,"

My main monitor is horizontal, while my second monitor on the right is vertical. I had a game running in fullscreen on my main monitor, and a terminal on my second monitor. After closing the terminal on my second monitor, the fullscreen game went black, and it extended across the main monitor into the top half of my second monitor. Toggling the fullscreen mode resulted in a coredump.

### How to reproduce

First time seeing hyprland coredump. You might repro this using my description.

Example plugin in `example/examplePlugin` is no longer buildable after first party package manager was added. Some Hyprland API got changed and there is missing `hyprpm.toml` for the new `hyprpm`.

I also checked `hyprwm/hyprland-plugins` and they seem to be fine.

### How to reproduce

- Clone repo
- Navigate to `example/examplePlugin`
- Run `make`

It  happens when i group all 3 windows of a workspace together.
Than activate fullscreen, changegroupactive a few times and then finally togglegroup makes it crash.

1785,Wayland Rofi Not Focusing,"stem update that happened a while ago now hyprland does not focus rofi when hovered. Instead all keyboard and mouse input is sent directly to rofi and hyprland keybinds such as quitting a window is sent to some focused window in the back (If present). The border that shows what window is focused also is showing on the background window (if present) and not on rofi like it did before.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open rofi (wayland fork) on any mode
2. Attempt to close it with hyprland keybind (Doesn't close)
3. Attempt to type text in background window while hovering on that window (typing always goes to rofi)

I have tested this on fuzzel as well and appear to be getting the same results.
Have tried both hyprland and hyprland-git",0
812,Regression: Wayland applications don't open with a not supported refresh rate,"

I upgraded to NixOS 23.11 and I could no longer open wayland applications on Hyprland

I have problems when I use `monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@68,auto,1` in my config  
I don't have problems when I use `monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,auto,1` in my config


- swaybg didn't startup
- fuzzel gave an error `err: wayland.c:2012: no monitors`

Terminator does run however, not entirely sure why.. but most applications completely fail to launch

Running at 68Hz has no problems in Hyprland 0.25.0

### How to reproduce

Probably on a laptop,

Run your monitor at 68Hz and see that wayland applications fail to start
Edit your config back to 60Hz and see that everything now runs normally

2361,New windows in inactive workspaces stealing focus,"ce:
One way is to first make sure you have a window rule assigning whatever browser you use to a specific workspace. I have these rules:
```
windowrule = workspace 1 silent,^(librewolf)$
windowrule = workspace 1 silent,^(firefox)$
```
Then you can go to [this page](https://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html), give it permission to display notifications, then click show in 5s. Switch to a fullscreen window in a different workspace, wait the 5 seconds for the notification window to open, and the active window will then be un-fullscreened.

Another way is by opening a terminal window and running something like this:
```sh
sleep 5; pavucontrol
```
And then again, switch to a fullscreen window in any workspace other than the one to which pavucontrol (or whatever program you choose to run) is assigned.
I have this window rule:
```
windowrule = workspace 4 silent,^(pavucontrol)$
```

Expected behavior:
If a workspace windowrule contains `silent` then matching windows should not get focus, unless that window's workspace is already the active one.

Actual behavior:
If the new window is in the same workspace as the focused one, that new window gets focus and the previous one does not get it back. I would say that's pretty normal behavior. When the new window opens in a different workspace, it seems to steal it momentarily and then give it right back to the previously focused window. The previously focused window regains focus whether `follow_mouse` is enabled or disabled.

I'm running both Hyprland and wlroots built from source, cloned less than an hour before posting this issue so I'm up to date",0
299,Touchpad swipe gesture doesn't autofocus on windows which not under mouse cursor.,"

When using touchpad swipe gesture to change workspace then it doesn't auto-focus on any window which isn't under the mouse cursor and in case of multiple floating windows, if the cursor is in between those windows then no window gains the focus, I have to manually move the cursor to the desired window and keybinding to change focus ($mod+left/right) doesn't work.

**But this isn't the issue with keybinding to switch workspace ($mod+1,2,3...). In this case auto-focus seems to work as expected.**

See the video and you will know what I am talking about.

### How to reproduce

Use small floating windows and keep the cursor in between those windows and change to different workspace and then use the swipe gesture keeping the cursor position same.

236,Changing from and to empty workspaces between monitors messes up selection,"

When switching back and forth from workspaces attached to monitors through rules, hyprland looses track of the actual workspace that should be selected and misplace it.

Attached a video as I could not screen record on multiple monitors.
In this video:
- Workspaces 4, 5, 6, 7 have a monitor rule on the left one
- Workspaces 8, 9, 10 have a monitor rule on the right one
- Workspaces 4, 5, 8 have windows on them, the others are empty
- Initially, workspace 6 is active
- I only press shortcuts to move to workspace 9 and 10, never 6. Yet it is selected sometimes and sometimes not
- It's not just a waybar display issue: when I try to open a window, it opens on the 6 even though I explicitly executed ""workspace 10"" right before
- Running `hyprctl workspaces -j` reveals no anomaly, workspaces are on the monitors they should be

```
bind=SUPER,9,workspace,9
bind=SUPER,0,workspace,10
```

https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/319220/e8dc12cc-c062-4141-a77d-dd6683d7ae69


### How to reproduce

- Have 2 monitors, see setup above
- Navigate between empty workspaces on different monitors
- Especially seems to happen when navigating on consecutive empty workspaces on the same monitor and another one from another monitor

1180,df51c45 effectively breaks waybar workspace scrolling,"

With the introduction of commit https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/df51c45d7f9e4e280b959f790f7cde6c88b9b451 it has become impractical to use scrolling to flick through workspaces with waybar as suggested by the wiki here, https://wiki.hyprland.org/hyprland-wiki/pages/Useful-Utilities/Status-Bars/#scrolling-through-workspaces
This is due to the cursor always being teleported to the center of the screen/new window every time the workspace is changed, requiring you to move the mouse back to the status bar between every scroll/workspace change.
This is not a bug if you consider the above wiki suggestion unsupported.

It is somewhat worth noting that workspace scrolling in this way was already somewhat unusable on multi-monitor setups because if e+1 or e-1 involved changing to a workspace on a different monitor this same issue would already occur.
However I considered this somewhat out of scope for Hyprland as the actual issue here is Waybar's current inability to scroll through workspaces present only on the current status bar (ie. the workspaces on the current monitor only) like it does natively under Sway, instead relying on the hacky e+1 e-1 method.

This change is also quite frustrating when switching workspaces by clicking on them, as the cursor is also teleported center, which makes changing your mind and choosing to click another workspace annoying and is just jarring in general.
Perhaps the 'fix' here is just to have some kind of option to disable mouse warping on workspace swapping? I don't _believe_ this is currently an option? Or better yet, a bool supplied to workspace change commands that optionally disables the cursor warping, as you would only really want this behavior under the above mentioned use cases, and I could see disabling cursor warping entirely when swapping workspaces as also being annoying when you use more traditional keybind methods of doing so.

### How to reproduce

Use https://wiki.hyprland.org/hyprland-wiki/pages/Useful-Utilities/Status-Bars/#scrolling-through-workspaces on any build after commit https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/df51c45d7f9e4e280b959f790f7cde6c88b9b451.

So the warning is false, and block the usage of those key.

I can still use keycode, but should we keep this piece of code? Do you plan to remove it at a moment and it was just to alert first users ?
Can we maybe add a boolean in config to bypass this warning ?

101,More than Two mod keys in a keybind fail to work.,"

I cannot create modifiers that contain more than two and have them work.  I am trying to create a hyper key which ought to be SUPER + CONTROL + ALT + SHIFT and a  meh key which ought to be CONTROL + ALT + SHIFT.    I can  bind with any combination of two but past that it does not work.

### How to reproduce

Try to define a hyper key as  I specified in the description then attempt to use it.   It will fail to work.    Otherwise looking good.   I am able to define these keys in I3 with no problem.

If it shows a dialog (after a crash for example), the dialog shows up, but the main window doesn't. The process keeps running and it's logs indicates, that it thinks it has a window. `hyprctl clients` doesn't show a window either, though.

Running it on *sway* works, so it's probably not a generic aversion to wayland or tiling wms.

I tried a directly installed version and the flatpak version - both on ArchLinux.

Additional Info: after many many many restarts it showed the main window once, but then failed to show one of its modal child windows, so I was stuck and couldn't continue (since I couldn't close the non-showing modal window)",0

 - Moving the cursor around causes dropped frames
 - glxgears doesn't reach 60 fps when moving cursor around
 - Scrolling in webpages isn't smooth
 - Minecraft (prime-run) has lots of small stutters (most frames will take 17-25 ms to render instead of 16 ms)

897,Firefox crash when moving cursor between monitors of different scales,"

I have two monitors, one is 4k of **scale 2** on the left and the other is 1080p of **scale 1** on the right:
```
monitor=DP-1, preferred, 0x0, 2
monitor=DP-2, preferred, 1920x0, 1
```

Firefox and other Firefox-based applications (such as Thunderbird) crash when the window is on the left screen, and I move the cursor around its right edge (which is also the boundary between monitors), see the video for details:

https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/5774651/7db691f8-c0f4-4348-8636-4564dfaf47f0

Specifically, the crash happens only if the two monitors are of different scales. For instance, the following two settings are fine:
```
monitor=DP-1, preferred, 0x0, 2
monitor=DP-2, preferred, 1920x0, 2
```
```
monitor=DP-1, preferred, 0x0, 1
monitor=DP-2, preferred, 3840x0, 1
```
but this also leads to a crash:
```
monitor=DP-1, preferred, 0x0, 1
monitor=DP-2, preferred, 3840x0, 2
```

### How to reproduce

1. Enable native wayland of firefox via `env = MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND,1`
2. Setup two monitors of different scales
3. Launch Firefox, make sure one edge of its window overlaps with the boundary between monitors
4. Move the cursor around the edge, observe FF crash

427,ext_workspace_unstable: hidden/urgent workspace state always false,"ing into the following issue and as a result dove a bit into the Waybar code, the Wayland unstable protocol that's still WIP, and slightly in Hyprland: https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/2121. The initial problem there is that Waybar is not setting the `.visible` class on workspaces retrieved via `ext_workspace_unstable`. The spec being used by Hyprland (which is not the latest) doesn't have a specific ""visible"" field, though it can be assumed ""visible"" if it's not hiddden I would assume (the spec isn't entirely clear).

Is it therefore perhaps possible to set hidden to true in case the workspace is not visible on the screen? Then a PR can be proposed in Waybar to set add the `.visible` class if it's not hidden. I've had a quick look through the code and it doesn't seem trivial to me to determine whether a workspace is ""visible"" or not.

In the same branch I noticed that ""urgent"", the other available state, is also always false. Perhaps both can be tackled at the same time",0

646,sluggish cursor under 99%+ gpu load ,"

GPU under 99%+ load causes stutter-y cursor in adjacent workspaces. 
I was playing warframe and noticed if I switched to different workspace, my cursor felt like its was under 60Hz. Its not just a feeling, I clearly saw large gaps between my cursor icon when moving it back and forth really fast. 
It doesn't feel stuttery in game, but only in other workspaces.  

### How to reproduce

1. Use my Hyprland.conf 
2. Launch [Warframe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/) from steam. 
3. Use [nvtop](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/nvtop/) to monitor gpu usage. 
4. In game max settings, no vsync or frame limit. 
5. switch to another workspace and move the cursor.

426,[XWAYLAND] Cannot drag anything in Unreal Engine,"
<summary>NOTE: Krita is fixed now, thanks! This still applies for Unreal Engine, so I am keeping the issue open. Expand to view the original issue including Krita</summary>

Krita does not support Wayland, and Unreal Engine does not respond to mouse input on Wayland, so I unfortunately have to run both under Xwayland. Both apps seem to exhibit the same bug, which is why I am grouping them in this issue.

In Krita, the primary way to manage layers is by dragging one up/down. When I do this in Hyprland, Krita appears to be unfocused for one frame, then focus is brought back to Krita and the drag-and-drop is instantly ""dropped"". If, within that frame, I was able to move my mouse to the desired destination, the layer does move, indicating that a drag and drop did indeed happen, but was ended nearly instantly.

In Unreal Engine, to interact with the ""Blueprints"" language, you drag links off of nodes (similar to Blender's shader editor).

Here is a video of the issue in Unreal Engine:
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44881120/233791623-f872688b-a7ac-4b35-b618-a0bc364a3280.mp4

[Logs from the video](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/11301581/unreal.log).

Additionally, focus as a whole is majorly broken on UE. If you open a right click menu and move your mouse over the options (especially to a sub-menu), the menu will close and put UE in a strange ""unfocused"" state, where the framerate is limited to 1fps and all menus instantly close when they are opened. Refocusing UE usually fixes this.

These two issues together make UE nearly impossible to use on Hyprland.

1896,blur_new_optimizations directive causes delay to background update when switching workspaces,"g an issue with transparency + blur.  If I have a terminal, such as `kitty` or `havoc` open with transparency and switch quickly to a workspace with an app that does not have transparency, such as firefox or obs-studio, and then quickly switch back to the terminal, there is no issue.  But if I permit the non-transparent workspace to remain active for more than about 15 seconds and switch back to the workspace with transparency, there is a ghost-image of the non-transparent application window that persists for anywhere from 1 to about 10 seconds before the background image gets applied as expected.

This issue only exists if `blur_new_optimizations` is enabled.  

I can provide additional details if needed.",0

Although it seems to work fine for most programs, I have consistently had issues with pop-up windows such as right click menus or dropdowns (Steam, GeoGebra, Android Studio).
The pop-up is initially blurry and too big, as if it were getting scaled up by Hyprland. There are also damage tracking issues when in this state. Sometimes it returns back to normal if I wait long enough. Manually dragging the popup also fixes it. I have not observed anything seemingly relevant in the logs, but happy to provide them if helpful. I have attached a video showcasing the issue.

622,movefocus binds behave incorrectly when window is fullscreened,"

When more than one window exists on a workspace and one is in fullscreen mode movefocus binds will cycle the other windows present in that workspace, and only that workspace, behavior changes depending on amount of windows and direction of movefocus.

I was going to submit this as a feature request to not consider windows behind a fullscreen window as valid movefocus targets, but this is actually a bug because of how it behaves when more than one monitor is involved.
Given two monitors, when a single window is present in a workspace and fullscreened, movefocus will happily move between the windows on each monitor. When multiple windows are present on a workspace and one is in fullscreen, movefocus will _only_ cycle between the windows on that monitor once focus has landed there, accessing the other monitor through movefocus becomes impossible.

I would expect movefocus to ignore any windows underneath a fullscreen window as if they don't exist.

### How to reproduce

Tile two windows side by side, fullscreen one of them, then attempt to use movefocus binds such as `bind = $mainMod, left, movefocus, l` and `bind = $mainMod, right, movefocus, r`.

9,Using focuswindow with follow_mouse=2 will warp cusor but not cursor focus.,"

If the follow_mouse variable is set to 2, using the focuswindow dispatcher will warp the cursor to the focused window but not move cursor focus. The cursor focus will stay on the previously focused window. In order to move cursor focus, you need to either click or move the cursor.

### How to reproduce

Set follow_mouse to 2, and no_cursor_warps to false. Select one window and then use the focuswindow dispatcher to move keyboard focus. Try scrolling on the newly focused window, and scroll will apply to the previously focused window.

Hovering the mouse over wofi causes it to immediatly crash. It does not crash when the cursor is elsewhere on the screen. 

The reason i am reporting this here is that it doesn't occur on sway and did not occur on hyprland prior to me updating the other day. Currently on nixos so i'm not entirely sure how to go back to an older version to check. Wofi has not been updated in several months either.

1068,Graphical Corruption when toggling fullscreen mode with vrr=2,"

Hyprland v0.29.0 has introduced a graphical corruption issue that was not present in v0.28.0 and earlier version.

When VRR is set to `vrr=2`, toggling fullscreen mode results in graphical corruption during both entry and exit of the fullscreen mode. This does not occur when VRR is set to `vrr=0` or `vrr=1`.

I use two monitors, with only one of them supporting VRR, yet I can replicate this issue on both monitors as long as VRR is set to `vrr=2`.

Notably, prior to v0.29.0, setting `vrr=2` globally did not display any graphical corruption on neither monitor.

### How to reproduce

Set `vrr=2` and then either spam toggle fullscreen or move the mouse while toggling fullscreen.

Another way to trigger this is to move my mouse from one monitor to the other and back again, graphical corruption will occur even without spamming or moving the mouse during fullscreen transition, but only for the first toggle cycle.

As the title suggests, today I tried to switch from the NixOS Hyprland module to the Home Manager one, closely following the [official instructions](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nix/#with-flakes-1) on the wiki. However, even if the NixOS module works flawlessly, after switching to the Home Manager one Hyprland started crashing at startup, reporting the `m_sWLRRenderer was NULL!` error that you can find in the log.

Reading from the threads in #40 and #913 I can understand that the problem may be caused by a graphic driver, but since the NixOS module-based installation works without any problem I don't think that my system is missing any package...

644,different keyboard layout depending on device breaks bindings (also in apps),"

I'm on a laptop. The keyboard integrated with the laptop is in AZERTY layout (French : `fr`)
When I'm home, I use my USB keyboard which is in a QWERTY layout (US-intl : `us`)

Now the issue, is that it feels like every bindings (on Hyprland but also on apps such as VSCode) are constantly on the AZERTY layout.

For example, I assigned SUPER + Q to quit a tab on my `fr` layout but when using my USB keyboard I have to use SUPER + A to trigger SUPER + Q. Same in VSCode, when I hit CTRL + Z it triggers CTRL + W, closing my file :')

It's strange because when I type, the characters are correct depending on the layout selected.

### How to reproduce

This is how I configured the layouts in my hyprland configuration file, maybe something's wrong here ?

```
input {
    kb_layout = fr
    kb_variant =
    kb_model =
    kb_options =
    kb_rules =

    numlock_by_default = yes
}

# Home QWERTY keyboard, should never be used in `fr` layout.

  kb_layout = us
  kb_variant = intl
  kb_options =

210,Hyprland crashes wayvnc,"

wayvnc on Hyprland crashes when opening or refreshing a window when a client is connected.

The issue was reported to any1/wayvnc/issues/248 and it seems it should be [fixed](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc/issues/248#issuecomment-1520677342), I think by this commit : https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/commit/eb570c88e65171eaf3a25d278640d80e42c3af9a

The neatvnc (lib used by wayvnc) [patch](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc/issues/248#issuecomment-1519036469) proposed at that time still works but the root of the problem may still be in Hyprland ?

### How to reproduce

- Create an headless output : `hyprctl output create headless` (not required but does not crash wayvnc instantly on my setup)
- Start `wayvnc`, it should select the headless monitor automatically
- Connect to the VNC server, I tested with [wlvncc](https://github.com/any1/wlvncc) and [MultiVNC](https://github.com/bk138/multivnc) : `wlvncc localhost`
- Move the cursor to the headless monitor (not hovering the VNC window) -> the cursor shows up in the VNC window and you can see it moving
- Try to open a window like wofi or a terminal (kitty)
- wayvnc crashes

260,Choppy Workspace Swipe,"

Whenever swiping to another workspace, if you hold the gesture (leave fingers on the trackpad) while you complete the gesture action (swipe as if you are completely on the new workspace), then you may sometimes not end up in the new workspace until moments after (instead holding an intermediary position during that time, hence choppy).

This is impractical because I would hold so I can gesture back to the previous workspace quickly without having to let go of the trackpad (efficiency aspect) or control of the percentage of the screen to view (feature aspect).

### How to reproduce

Hold swipe while performing a complete workspace swipe option.

The action performed should be with modest to fast speed. The faster, the more likely to occur. It also seems more likely to remain in the ""choppy"" state for a longer duration of time when the gesture is done faster.

Repeatedly swipe quickly, but lift the hand off the trackpad for each attempt, as there is a chance the problem will occur for each gesture. If you can replicate in a single gesture, holding that gesture and repeatedly swiping with the given gesture (not lifting the hand) lets you repeatedly experience the bug.

Building wlroots-hyprland works just fine when using the packages output of the flake, but the when using overlays it fails. 
From my understanding of the flake.nix file I think it's not applying custom version of those 2 libs (https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/flake.nix#L35-L63) when you use it as overlay. So it fall backs to the nixpkgs one (the one that you are applying the overlay to).
You can see that it applies those version in packages over here https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/flake.nix#L110.

Possible fix: 
1) Adding libs directly into overrides? https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/flake.nix#L74-L77
2) Moving https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/flake.nix#L35-L63 into the overlays?

179,Respect panel_orientation_quirks when determining default rotation,"

The Linux kernel has a mapping of [known devices to their primary intended orientation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_panel_orientation_quirks.c).  This is useful, for instance, in gaming handhelds, where portrait-oriented tablet screens are installed in a landscape orientation.  Hyprland should use thie by default - displaying in the orientation described by the kernel if present.

### How to reproduce

Install Hyprland on a device listed in [`drm_panel_orientation_quirks`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_panel_orientation_quirks.c) (or patch the kernel to add a quirk for the device you're testing on), and observe that Hyprland does not automatically match the prescribed rotation with

163,Screen off close app,"

When I turn off the screen manually or after a while swayidle turns it off.

I lose my open applications which seem to have been killed
(firefox, foot, thunar etc...)

But when I open foot and open with for example thunar, it works, but it opens a new workspace for me.

I had exactly the same problem when I tried labwc, but strangely I never had this problem with Wayfire which I used on a daily before.

### How to reproduce

Turn off monitor or wait swayidle

1474,"""Communication with the local password server failed"" when using Dolphin"," am having with Dolphin, the KDE file manager, is seen whenever I attempt to connect to a network share that has credentials stored presumably in KDE Wallet.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Dolphin
2. Connect to a network share (SMB, SFTP, FTP...) that requires authentication
A Samba share with locked folders works too.
3. ""Communication with the local password server failed"" appears, at which point it has entirely failed to ask the user to authenticate at all.

The CLI outputs this:
```
kf.kio.core: Can't communicate with kiod_kpasswdserver (for queryAuthInfo)!
kf.kio.core: ""Communication with the local password server failed""
```
...whereas the expected outcome is for it to communicate with Wallet, fetch the credentials in there and let the user carry on unabated.

I'm unsure if it's a KDE issue or a Hyprland issue, but I figured I might as well share it here.
Seems as though there is some miscommunication between KDE and Wallet, which is something I have also noticed with other things (like certain apps such as Steam and Flatpak apps not opening the file select dialog)",0
91,Held keys not passed to wayland clients on keyboard::enter,"

Held keys are not passed to a window when it's activated.

### How to reproduce

- Run blender 4.0 from a terminal with the command:
  
  `blender --log ""ghost.wl.handle.keyboard.*"" --log-level 2`

- Hover the cursor over the blender window and press the Super key.
- Move the cursor to another window and back to change focus, re-focusing on the Blender window.

The following warning is printed:

```

Notice the `key_held=133` is set as part of keyboard::enter.

1911,HDMI projector not recognized on Hyprland but works fine on X11,"eproduce: trying to plug an HDMI monitor (projector here) while being on Hyprland
Expected outcome: projector acts as a working 2nd monitor
Noted outcome: it doesn't (`hyprctl monitors` doesn't even notice it, only lists eDP-1)

Config file: https://github.com/Aakodal/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
Note that, following raf's advices, I replaced the `monitor=,preferred,auto,1` line with
```
monitor=eDP-1,1366x768@60,0x0,1
monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1
```
but nothing has changed.

Also I'm on a laptop.

Log file (monitor has been plugged/unplugged many times):

When switching between two workspaces that both have fullscreen windows, the window on the workspace being switched to does not render until the animation is complete. Much more noticable when using workspace swipe.

OS: Arch Linux
Hyprland Config: basically the default config with some color theme and keybinds modification, removed all exec-once, and used all the envvar(including envvar for Nvidia GPU) from the wiki.

177,workspace_swipe_numbered causes windows to disappear on the first workspace,"

Having the two configurations:

- workspace_swipe = on
- workspace_swipe_numbered = true

causes windows on specifically the first workspace to disappear (they do not actually close, just visually disappear) when swiping to the second workspace. 

### How to reproduce

1. Open any amount of windows on workspace 1
2. have workspace_swipe = on and workspace_swipe_numbered = true in config file
3. swipe (slower swipes are easier to see, but works with fast ones as well) to the second workspace
4. the windows disappear while swiping. They do come back when swiping back.

302,"xwayland force_zero_scaling actually does scale, just very slightly.","

At certain scaling factors, even with force_zero_scaling, xwayland apps are told to render at a resolution that is 1 or 2 pixels short of the resolution they should render at, and then scaled up to the proper resolution. 

On my 2560x1600 monitor, a global scaling factor of 1.3 will cause a fullscreen xwayland program to render with a resolution of 2559x1598.

### How to reproduce

1. Enable zero scaling for xwayland.
2. Set a non-integer scaling factor.
3. Run this command. It will report the size of the xev window when it receives configures.
```
xev -event structure
```
4. Fullscreen xev, and compare its text output with the known resolution of your screen.
5. Change your scaling factor a bit, if the output and resolution of your screen are the same.

769,Cyclenext dispatcher doesn't work consistently on master layout.,"

I tried to write an issue on this problem quite long ago, but I did not describe it clear enough, so here it is.

The layoutmsg:cyclenext doesn't work with float windows, I know this is intended, so I'll just have to use the cyclenext dispatcher, right? But this dispatcher has some weird interacts (or at least with master layout).

1. Cyclenext works opposite of layoutmsg:cyclenext (next = prev & prev = next), so I have to set the keybinds the opposite way, this is fine with me.
2. When I open a float window(A), open another window then set the float to tiled, the order of windows got messed up. To fix this I have to toggle float on window(A) again.

### How to reproduce

1. Install Hyprland on artixlinux (basically Arch linux)
2. Set general:layout = master; master:new_is_master = false; master:new_on_top = true
3. Set keybinds for cyclenext dispatcher (not the layoutmsg ones)

355,Don't resize windows when inheriting fullscreen,"ster layout with fullscreen inheriting enabled, I think it would be better to not resize back to tile the windows that lose focus when cycling clients.
This resizing, especially with animations disabled, causes the clients to resize everytime they are brought in focus.

One of the issues is with Firefox, when a page requests fullscreen and then I switch to other clients on the workspaces, when I return to Firefox the internal fullscreen is disabled(the url bar returns visible)
To reproduce just open firefox on url https://davidwalsh.name/demo/fullscreen.php and a terminal on the same workspace, toggle hyprland fullscreen on Firefox, click on Launch Fullscreen in the web page, and cycle clients two times to return to Firefox, the internal fullscreen will be disabled",0

2558,Crashes when closing a window with multiple monitors connected," the bug**
When I hit Mod+C to close a window and have a second HDMI monitor connected, Hyprland crashes immediately.

**Images/videos/anything that would help**


Please attach a log (it's in /tmp/hypr/hyprland.log) and, if crashing, a crashdump (coredumpctl, then coredumpctl info <pid>)

*Please do NOT attach coredumps from any packaged version of Hyprland (AUR, etc.). Compile manually, and THEN attach a coredump of that.*

[hyprland.log](https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland/files/8819882/hyprland.log)

EDIT: It is now just crashing everytime I try and close a window, even with no external monitor connected.

I have only added this line to my config:
`monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1` and it seems to be the cause, as I then get crashes.

I can add `monitor=HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1` to my config (and get mirrored displays) and do not get any crashes, as long as I don't have the above eDP line. However if I add any offset it crashes when closing windows as well.

1080,Can I force the mouse position on the specified monitor when hyprland starts？,"

I'm using dual monitors, and I've set them up to go up and down. But I found that when I entered my account password into hyprland, the default mouse start position was always at the bottom of the display. 

I also used xrandr to set up the above monitor as the primary monitor, but this didn't work

Can I force the mouse position on the specified monitor when hyprland starts？

my monitor.conf
```
monitor = ,preferred,auto,1
monitor = eDP-1,preferred,0x0,1
monitor = DP-1,preferred,0x1080,2
workspace = 1,monitor:eDP-1,default:true
workspace = 2,monitor:DP-1
exec-once = xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary
```

901,1440p 165hz screen is stuck at 1440p 120hz,"

My primary monitor is 2560x1440 165hz but in hyprland it's only detected as 2560x1440 120hz. 
165hz works in windows so I know its not a hardware issue but a software/driver issue.

I have tried both highres, highrr and 2560x1440@165 with the same result.

This is my hyprland.conf
```bash
monitor = DP-1,highres, 1920x0, 1
monitor = HDMI-A-1,highres,0x0,1
monitor = DVI-D-1,highres,1920x-1080,1

879,"Keys being ""toggled"" if while pressed SUPER is also pressed.","

With a bind like `SUPER+Q` to open the terminal, if while holding `Q` I were to tap `SUPER`, then, even after releasing all keys, `Q` stays ""pressed"".

It only seems to happen with keys used in binds, I haven't tested if the same would happen using a modifier key other than `SUPER`.

key goes _**brrrrrrr**_

### How to reproduce

With a bind, like `SUPER+Q`  (MODS: `SUPER` + key: `Q`),
while holding `Q`, press `SUPER`, then release keys,
`Q` acts like its still being pressed.

166,resizewindowpixel buggy or documentation incomplete,"

When setting negative vec2 values via `hyprctl dispatch resizewindowpixel -100 -100,address:0x55b95f0f0860` I get an error (hyprctl usage text appears). Sometimes one of the negative values (left or right) works but the other doesn't.  

There seems to be some logic behind the current behavior but it's not obvious from the documentation. Naturally I would assume the vec2 value is a x,y coordinate but that seems not to be the case. 

Also setting resizewindow to ""exact 50% 50%"" I would intuitively expect the targeted/selected window to occupate a square of a quarter of the monitor space or to reduce the window size by half. That's not the case either. 

I just simply want to programmatically  resize the windows in the current workspace relatively to the monitor space (for example setting each of the 8 windows in the workspace to 25% monitor width and 25% monitor height).

### How to reproduce

571,Dropshadows are occluded by transparent windows even with decoration:shadow_ignore_window=false,"

I recently upgraded from a February 10th build to the latest commit as of the time of writing. After upgrading and restarting, I've found that dropshadows have begun getting occluded by transparent window borders even when `decoration:shadow_ignore_window` has been configured to `false`. (see screenshot)

### How to reproduce

1. Build Hyprland from latest source
2. Add `shadow_ignore_window = false` to the `decoration` section of Hyprland's config
3. Ensure that window borders are not disabled and have a positive size
4. Add `col.active_border = rgba(00000000)` to the `general` section of Hyprland's config
5. Restart Hyprland
6. Note the unexpected appearance of the dropshadow

449,Fullscreen window focusing is incomplete.,"llscreen mode it's not possible to go backwards through the stack of windows, you can only go forwards.

`movefocus l` and `movefocus r` both go forwards in the window stack when they should go opposite directions.
Same thing for `movefocus u` and `movefocus d`.

`cyclenext prev` starts cycling in the opposite direction of `cyclenext` but after the 2nd call it will go back to the original window, so if we have windows 1-2-3 and we are on window 1 it will do this:

```

cyclenext prev -> window 3
cyclenext prev -> window 1 (should be 2)
cyclenext prev -> window 3 (should be 1)

1038,I cannot engage with the Hyprland community on Discord,"

I'd like to engage with the Hyprland community to ask questions and exchange ideas etc, but that seems to be impossible because the Hyprland website only links to Discord; a restrictive, malicious and privacy invasive web service and proprietary product.

While I have tolerated it in exceptional situations before, it seems that now, for joining the Hyprland ""server"", I have to enter my phone number and verify it. Unfortunately, this is where my tolerance of the platform ends.

I could go on with the irony of promoting a proprietary application that doesn't even properly work on your very own WM, or how inappropriate it is to lure unsuspecting users and to make them give up their freedom, but I'm certain those who read this far got the point.
(If not, I *highly* recommend [this Article on gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html) that explains the major issues with proprietary software.)

---

### Suggestion

Because a community cannot be moved from one platform to another very easily, suggest enabling more than one platform, and connect them.

Specifically speaking, this could be a [Matrix space](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/public-rooms/#spaces) where channels are [bridged with Discord channels](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/discord). A similar solution could be possible [with IRC](https://github.com/OpenTTD/dibridge) as well.

That way, malicious software would not be imposed on those interested in interacting with the community, and it would allow those who are trapped in Discord to break free from the restrictive platform.

Moreover, a bridge solution would not force any of the oppressed users to move away from the restrictive platform.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

### How to reproduce

The issue is Discord:
A reproduction of Discord as it is, is not required - and definitely not wanted.

813,hyprpm loads plugin after it's needed by other loading steps,"

When loading a plugin by enabling it with 'hyprpm', an error is thrown by Hyprland that it cannot find the layout and directives included in the plugin.
Running hyprctl after loading Hyprland fixes the error.

hyprctl plugins list returns the plugin as loaded correctly.

When disabling the plugin using hyprpm and loading it directly in the config when by using:
'plugin = /home/<user>/.local/share/hyprpm/hy3/hy3.so' 
Fixes the issue.

My suspicion is that when using hyprpm, the plugin is loaded at a later stage then the bind and layout settings in the Hyprland.conf are evaluated.
While when using the plugin entry in the config file, this is evaluated before the bind and layout settings are evaluated. 

### How to reproduce

install a plugin using hyprpm. (in my case I've used hy3).
- `hyprpm add https://github.com/outfoxxed/hy3`
enable the plugin
- `hyprpm enable hy3`

use the hy3:makegroup or any of the hy3 directives with a keybind.

restart Hyprland (preferably a cold boot).

You should get an error that an error occured while starting Hyprland and that the directive hy3:makegroup could not be found.

When using the hy3 layout, you can also see in the logs that Hyprland is unable to find the layout.

Running `hyprctl reload` should fix this error.

1055,Master layout movewindow behaves the same as swapwindow between monitors,"

Previously when moving windows between monitors using a keybind to movewindow it would place that window on the other monitor and leave the other windows on that monitor as would be expected with movewindow.
It now behaves exactly the same as swapwindow where when moving between monitors it'll swap whatever window is currently on the other monitor/workspace.



### How to reproduce

use master window layout
use keybinds to move window between monitors (eg.. bind = $mainMod SHIFT, left, movewindow, l)

123,blurred waybar + hyprpaper fails to update wallpaper behind waybar when no windows are present,"

I have enabled blurring on waybar, tested with both blurls and layerrule. I am using hyprpaper to change wallpapers when I change workspace. When I navigate between two workspaces that each have windows, the wallpaper is correctly updated behind waybar -- when I naviagte to a workspace that has no windows the wallpaper is not updated behind waybar. If I open a window in the empty space the background behind waybar corrects itself

### How to reproduce

- preload multiple images in hyprpaper
- add layerrule/blurls for waybar
- bind workspace navigation to change wallpaper with `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper """"` as per documentation
- Use bind to switch between workspaces that have windows and no windows open

2022,Some apps take a long time to open when Hyprland first starts,"have an issue where apps like firefox and nwg-panel take somewhere around 20 seconds to load when hyprland first starts. I have seen the FAQ but the solution doesn't seem to work for me.

Just adding `exec-once=dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` does nothing. I then put the script below it into a file and added it to the config as an `exec-once` line in the config, both before and after the dbus line. This didn't work.

I then tried to make my own script, which is as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash
killall xdg-desktop-portal-wlr &
killall xdg-desktop-portal &
dbus-run-session Hyprland &
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP &
systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP &

388,Using different natural_scroll variable for input and touchpad does not work,"
Hyprland is not crashing.

## Expected Outcome

Since it's possible to configure `natural_scoll` both in the input global section and the input:touchpad section, I assume that it should be possible that my mouse uses the normal behavior and the touchpad uses the mac behavior.

## Problem

However when I configure different values for both keys, the global key wins and configures the behavior for both devices.

Excerpt from my hyprland.conf:

```
input {
    kb_layout = de
    kb_variant = nodeadkeys
    kb_model = pc105
    kb_options =
    kb_rules =

    float_switch_override_focus = 1
    follow_mouse = 1
    natural_scroll = 0
    sensitivity = 0

    touchpad {
        clickfinger_behavior = 1
        disable_while_typing = 1
        natural_scroll = 1
        tap-to-click = 1
    }

315,SDL2 program crashes Hyprland (doesn't happen through xwayland),"

happens in both debug and normal builds

with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` the wall texture gets replaced by the healthkit texture and the game does freeze but I can still do anything else in Hyprland and sometimes the game even recovers

I can't get a crash report in the debug build, the hyprland log and coredump are both from the debug build but I managed to get a crash report in the normal build, attached all of those

not sure if this is in any way connected to the crash or if it helps you out, but when running ezquake wayland native at first my cursor gets stuck in the top left corner, when I refocus (go to another workspace and then back) it isn't stuck but the game doesn't capture it, then the 2nd time I refocus it all works; running ezquake through xwayland it all just works

### How to reproduce

install ezquake (only tested the appimage)

get the .pak files, put them into `$ezquake_dir/id1`

run ezquake, open the console (~) and run `map dm3`

without doing anything, open the console again if it closed and run `r_drawflat 1`

the wall texture should be replaced by a wiggling and flickering healthkit texture (only tested on amd, this happens on x11, xwayland and wayland, not sure about nvidia)

at that point just do some random stuff in game, run around, shoot, jump, whatever

after a while the game will freeze, you won't be able to switch ttys or do anything in Hyprland

wait a few seconds, you should be able to switch ttys and move the mouse cursor, besides that you can't do anything in Hyprland

wait for the crash

Ok..say i've set my alacritty windowrule to have some transparency...the first time I focus the app, the opacity is as specified however on opening another app and focusing back on the previous one the opacity for some reason gets below the specified amount...this only happens when an app has windowrule transparency not regular apps so could we maybe make it so that the windowrule opacity literally overrides the `active_opacity` setting and makes sure the window stays at the specified opacity? Basically I don't want its opacity to keep changing even after setting my `active_opacity` to `1`.

951,Memory leak & crash - Fedora 38 - AMD,"

Hyprland leaks memory until maximum available hardware RAM (32GB) is utilized and then crashes. 

### How to reproduce

Can be reproduced during manual binded user lock and unlock while utilizing swayidle and swaylock. Also, if utilizing docking station with multiple monitor setup resuming a swaylocked user session will cause multiple freezes during login, resulting in a reboot to temporarily resolve the issue.

Can also be reproduced while launching alacritty after login, similar to https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3848.

1198,wlr_output_management_v1 protocol not implemented properly,"

I am trying to update [rot8](https://github.com/efernau/rot8) to support Hyprland, by making it use the wlroots output_management protocol to apply output rotations. I have it working in Sway, but in Hyprland I'm seeing some unusual behavior.

I can find the display and apply a new configuration with the transform modified, but the output doesn't actually rotate. I get an OutputConfiguration::Success event, but no new configuration serial is advertised via OutputManager::Done event. On future rotation attempts, the configuration change is cancelled, likely because an incorrect serial number was provided. Also, new transforms aren't reported via the OutputHead::Transform event when rotating an output using `hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,preferred,auto,1,transform,1`.

I could just add a hyprland-specific backend which uses hyprctl to communicate, but would love to get to a single implementation for all wlroots compositors.

### How to reproduce

Clone [my branch](https://github.com/Smona/rot8/tree/wlroots-support) and `cargo run` with rustc and cargo installed, both on sway and hyprland.

2522,Screen blinking rapidly when starting Hyprland," time i start Hyprland from it blinks very rapidly until i invoke a command that changes something on the screen.
Having some experience with graphics i would guess that it has to do with the double buffering.
If there was only one time that the screen was drawn, and then you swap te buffers, the other one is still black, so i get blinking in a frequency of the screen refresh rate.
So it just has to be dawn two times once Hyprland was started.

1508,noborder creates transparent borders," to remove borders for firefox nightly like this (10 for easy inspection):

```
general {
    border_size = 10
}

windowrule = noborder,^(firefox-nightly)$
```

But there is still a 10-pixel border around firefox, just transparent. (For transparent borders, one can just set border_color to a transparent color.)

I want firefox to be really noborder due to fractional scale issues. Firefox can do fraction scale by setting `widget.wayland.fractional_buffer_scale` to the scale value in `about:config`. But with scale=1.25 and border_size=1, it means Firefox window starts at (1.25, 1.25) which isn't a whole pixel, making text blurry. Setting border_size=1.25 doesn't seem to work, and setting to 4 is too large.

878,Grim/Grimshot/Grimblast Segmentation Fault (Signal 11),"

Grimblast (also tested with Grim and Grimshot) causes a segmentation fault in Hyprland, crashing the system to the display manager.

Note I am using Fedora, expecting zero support but this is an interesting bug.

### How to reproduce

Run a grim screenshot program whether through the terminal or via Hyprland's macro system.
Session crashes to the display manager.

699,Using movecurrentworkspacetomonitor does not focus the moved workspace.,"

I'm using the following to move my workspaces around my monitor.
```
bind = $mainMod ALT, period, movecurrentworkspacetomonitor, +1
bind = $mainMod ALT, comma, movecurrentworkspacetomonitor, -1
```
When I do so my cursor moves with the active workspace, as expected. However, my focus does not move to the new monitor. Therefore, subsequent calls to movecurrentworkspacetomonitor act on the original monitor.

For example suppose I had the following workspaces:
- M1: 
  - Workspace 1
- M2: 
  - Workspace 2 
- M3
  - Workspace 3 < Cursor, Focus
  - Workspace 4

After using the binding above to move Workspace 3: I have the following:
- M1: 
  - Workspace 1
- M2: 
  - Workspace 2
  - Workspace 3 < Cursor
- M3:
  - Workspace 4 < Focus

I would expect to have: 
- M1: 
  - Workspace 1
- M2: 
  - Workspace 2
  - Workspace 3 < Cursor, Focus
- M3:
  - Workspace 4
 
This mean that when I press the bind again, instead of the following:
- M1: 
  - Workspace 1
  - Workspace 3 < Cursor, Focus
- M2: 
  - Workspace 2
- M3:
  - Workspace 4
 
what happens instead is:
- M1: 
  - Workspace 1
- M2: 
  - Workspace 2
  - Workspace 3 < Cursor, Focus
  - Workspace 4
- M3:
  - Workspace 5 [NEW]

Workspace 4 moves in the background and is not even set to active. I can workaround this doing anything to set a window active in Workspace 3. However, I'd like to be able to make multiple moves in a row without having to add extra steps. Additionally, this is not consistent with how window movements work.

### How to reproduce

1. Create a bind for movecurrentworkspacetomonitor -1

2. Create a monitor setup like the following (M is monitor, W is workspace):
- M1:
  - W1
- M2:
  - W2
- M3:
  - W3
  - W4

3. Use the bind to move W3 to M2.
    - W4 will be focused instead of W3
5. Repeat the bind to move W3 to M1.
    - W4 will move instead of W3.
    - W3 will become focused.

10,System freeze on Firefox tab tear,"

System freezes sometimes when I tear a Firefox tab to another monitor while also having many other things in the background. 

By tearing, I mean dragging the tab from on top of the browser window to a different monitor to open it there as a new instance of firefox.

Cursor just freezes on the last pixel of the monitor the original tab is from. 

### How to reproduce

Have multiple programs open, and maybe a Youtube video playing thru Firefox. Then open a new tab, or tear an existing one to a different monitor. Can't reproduce it consistently, but happens daily under heavy use.

1380,Hyprland freezes after a random amount of time (mouse frozen aswell),"

Hyprland freezes after a while of use could be like 1 minute to 6 hours, I think it's related to NVIDIA? The reason why I think this is because of the fact if I'm watching netflix and screensharing on discord it will freeze for a moment and then unfreeze.

Freezing meaning: My whole computer freezes no input and audio is still playing

### How to reproduce

I would have no clue how to reproduce this because it's just simply random it seems but it might be related to #2742

Additional Notes:
Not a lot to this report yet, I'll try to gather more information if I can, perhaps see if anyone else is noticing this?

*Also it would be pretty neat if you added an ""Additional Notes"" section to the Bug Reporting template.*

### How to reproduce

No idea. It seems to just build up with a lot of usage, may have something to do with system suspend though as I tend to use that a lot?

no help

Similar stuff, also no help.
Currently I'm trying to use `wezterm` and `sirula`, both takes a super long time to open.

609,Opening many windows of same type crashes hyprland,"

When opening many windows of the same program tested with alacritty and kitty. It core dumps. I counted the number of windows that I opened by moth it was over 15 windows opened.

### How to reproduce

1. Open 15 windows from eg kitty

1117,"The screen will be black after entering the account password,","

 installed archlinux and hyprland on my miniPC, which has only one integrated graphics card. After installation I saw the login interface, but after entering the account password displayed a black screen. I checked the log via tty4, and there were a lot of error messages in the middle, which may mean that the rendering was not successful. 

I tried hyprland hyprland-git separately. It's all like this. But when I loaded the hard drive into my ROG laptop, I also used the integrated graphics card to boot it up, and everything worked fine, logging in and using it properly. Please help me confirm what exactly is the problem? What drivers do I need to install if I want to use it on my miniPC with Intel integrated graphics

843,Swithing to a workspace which has a fullscreen window instantly hides the previous workspace,"

Video...
I already know that fullscreen hides all other windows on the same workspace (with an animation though), however when switching from another (non-fullscreen) workspace its content is already empty when the animation starts.

### How to reproduce

(default config works as well)
- Two workspaces
- Open a window on the first one
- Now on the second one, and make it fullscreen (normal or fake)
- Switch between the workspaces

1167,Dwindle layout: movewindow in special workspace yeets the window out of special workspace,"

Dwindle layout.
In special workspace, if you try to move windows around using movewindow, it will move your window out of special workspace and into the main workspace
Expected bahavior: window should stay in special workspace

### How to reproduce

1. Set layout to dwindle
2. Send a few windows into special workspace
3. Open special workspace
4. Use movewindow to move windows around

893,Binded alt key for hotkeys triggers alt menu on apps,"

If you bind the Alt Key for a shortcut, for example changing the keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcut triggers the Alt Menu on apps such as Firefox, Masterpdfeditor or QOwnNotes. As this does **not** happen when switching the keyboard layout via the input section `input { kb_options: grp:alt_shift_toggle }`, I would consider this a bug.

### How to reproduce

In your `hyprland.conf`, paste the following line:
```
bind = Alt, SHIFT_L, exec, hyprctl switchxkblayout at-translated-set-2-keyboard next
```
After saving the file, open Firefox and switch the keyboard layout via the alt and left shift key (normal `SHIFT` doesn't work as a bind for some reason?). The Alt Menu (File, Edit, History, View, etc...) will open. This prevent further typing until the alt key is pressed again, which is annoying.

Now, replace the line above with the following line:
```
input { kb_options: grp:alt_shift_toggle }
```
Redo the same steps and the Alt Menu will not open anymore. As the bind option would offer much more freedom (e.g. invoke additional script that updates an eww bar), it would be awesome to be able to use said option as well without having it trigger the Alt Menu on apps that support it.

Switched inputs on monitor, hyprland crashed.
[hyprlandCrashReport1874.txt](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/13653702/hyprlandCrashReport1874.txt)

2150,Performance issues with a high workspace ID open," was doing beforehand:
I was doing some testing to see what the highest workspace possible with Hyprland is. It came up to 2147483647.\
Then, when I was done, I just kept a terminal window open to not close off that workspace.\
But afterwords, the compositor froze when I used certain methods for switching workspaces.

### How to recreate
Doing `hyprctl dispatch workspace e+1` would cause a lag spike, and swiping left/right on trackpad also caused the same lag spice.

Image of bottom showing it uses all resources for a small amount of time (it just shows that only 1 core is being used to process this, but this 1 core is halting the entire wm)
![btm in terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57488297/203316655-4d773b0d-f577-4259-8aeb-929de13b2c8f.png)

#### Extra note
Another thing to note is that there is no lag when switching from any workspace using the trackpad from 1 to the last workspace from the large gap. So in this image I can switch through all the workspaces just fine except for with workspace 10 which lags even when I try to swipe to the left (to get to workspace 5).
![Open workspaces in waybar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57488297/203317192-c1fb165e-fff5-4e5d-81fe-0f325f18fe6d.png)
The lag also doesn't happen when using the `hyprctl` command to switch manually to that workspace (and the sliding animation plays just fine)

#### Suggestion to fix this
Could there be a list storing all the indexes of the open workspaces, then when switching workspaces you get the ID of the workspace to show by subtracting or adding 1 from the index of the current open index.\
This is because what I think you are doing (I haven't checked the code, so this is just a guess) is going changing workspace ID's until you reach one that has a window open.





This is probably a very low priority as I don't think anyone is going to open up 2147483647 workspaces any time soon, but best to have this report in case someone actually needs that many workspaces for some reason",0
1172,Changing mfact using keyword doesn't update until layout change,"

I have a script that I want to use to toggle the `mfact` of the master window in the master layout. Unless I include the lines to switch the layout type, the master window does not update. `getoption` does however return the correct value. Here is the current script:

```
#!/bin/sh

if [ $(hyprctl getoption master:mfact -j | jq -r "".float"") == ""0.330000"" ]
then
    hyprctl keyword master:mfact 0.5
    hyprctl keyword general:layout ""dwindle""
    hyprctl keyword general:layout ""master""
else
    hyprctl keyword master:mfact 0.33
    hyprctl keyword general:layout ""dwindle""
    hyprctl keyword general:layout ""master""
fi
```

Ideally the `hyprctl keyword general:layout ...` lines shouldn't be necessary.

### How to reproduce

`hyprctl keyword master:mfact 0.5`

nothing happens.

176,Cursor scaling applied only when not over windows on scaled monitors,"

When moving the mouse cursor over a monitor that has a scale != 1, the cursor is not scaled while over windows (or non-background layers).





### How to reproduce

- Have monitors with scale factor that is not equal to one.  Example:
```
monitor=DP-1, 2560x2880@60, 0x0, 1.33333
monitor=DP-2, 3840x2160@144, 1920x0, 1, vrr, 1
monitor=DP-3, 2560x2880@60, 5760x0, 1.3333
```
- Have gaps configured so the cursor can be seen moving between background and windows (or use floating windows?  I have not tried that yet)
- Move the cursor between an open window and the background, observing the change in size

2342,Gtk-layer-shell window loses (mouse?) focus on workspace change,"a like regression, works fine on 11 days old version.

I have a gtk-layer-shell status bar, unfocusable (keyboard wise). There is a gtk `EventBox` on it, which catches mouse wheel events and switches workspaces.

When I place mouse cursor on the `EventBox` and start scrolling around the current workspace do switch a couple of times and then gets stuck.

Moving cursor a little unstucks the thing until it gets stuck again.
It seems like, despite the fact that the cursor stays rendered on the same spot, its actual position jumps into some oblivion and then restores itself after I do some mouse movement.

I have noticed that previously when I was switching workspaces via my status bar the active window indicator (border) stayed on the previous workspace until I moved the mouse cursor over some window on the current workspace.
Currently, that is not the case and the active window changes immediately after the workspace changes.
May be related.

1166,Workspace dissapear when unplugging monitor,"

My workspaces are divided over my monitors as

```
workspace = eDP-1, 1
workspace = eDP-1, 3
workspace = eDP-1, 5
workspace = eDP-1, 7

workspace = HDMI-A-1, 2
workspace = HDMI-A-1, 4
workspace = HDMI-A-1, 6
```

When I unplug my monitors the workspaces (and their open apps) disappear including the special workspace if it is opened there.

### How to reproduce

- Set config
- open apps on workspaces
- disconnect
- Profit(?)

1362,Daisy-chained monitor does not work with multi-GPU laptop,"

I was recently able to configure my laptop with Hyprland using the AUR package `hyprland-nvidia` and I followed the steps in the *Multi GPU* page of the wiki.

Now I am able to use my USB-C for DisplayPort and my first monitor works as intended, however the daisy-chained one does not.

The monitor is properly detected from `hyprland monitors`:

But the screen stays black. 

On my other DE, KDE Plasma, all monitors work perfectly.

### How to reproduce

Have a dual GPU laptop (in my case AMD + NVIDIA).

Use USB-C to connect to the first monitor.

Daisy chain monitor 1 to monitor 2 via DP cable.

Enable required flags in the monitor settings (MST for me).

Using the Zoom video conferencing software, I get issues that I only get on Hyprland (i.e. these issues I cannot reproduce on Gnome nor KDE (tested each on X11 and Wayland).

- Issue I: Popup listboxes immediately (1 second or less) disappear after opening them
- Issue II: Screen sharing produces only a black shared screen


### How to reproduce

- Install Zoom
- Click ""New Meeting"" and ""Join with computer Audio""

Issue I:
- On the bottom bar click one of the small arrows to open the popup listboxes
- Notice them disappearing immediately

Issue II:

1481,Plugin: getting data from a monitor (g_pCompositor->m_vMonitors) throws segfault,"this plugin: https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces

Since [this commit](fbabb105c3427fbbce4dfc3ea9701ba473298206), accessing data from a monitor ([example](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces/blob/main/src/main.cpp#L67)) crashes Hyprland entirely. Even just printing `std::cout << monitor << std::endl;` will crash it.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Checkout this commit: fbabb105c3427fbbce4dfc3ea9701ba473298206
2. Use a plugin that accesses `g_pCompositor->m_vMonitors`, and make it access one of the monitors
3. Start Hyprland with the default config. Load the plugin in the config, or manually through hyprctl plugin load.

### Expected outcome
The plugin should work the same as it does with the parent commit fbabb105c3427fbbce4dfc3ea9701ba473298206

### Noted outcome
The plugin crashes Hyprland when loading the plugin.

1134,"TTY launch segfaults on Gentoo, XWayland launch works fine","

Hi, I'm trying to get this working on Gentoo. I encountered a strange issue where Hyprland runs okay when launched from a terminal using XWayland but crashes immediately with a segfault if I try launching it from a TTY (using dbus or just exec) as well as through a display manager (sddm).

Looking at the error logs the backtrace goes through `wlr_drm_backend_create` and the log from a successful XWayland launch shows it's successfully creating the backend right after the error log from a failed launch cuts off. I'm assuming it's something related to the renderer backend but I'm not sure how these things work enough to be able to understand the issue. Any ideas what could be causing this?

I'll attach the error log with the backtrace below.

Installed package versions are as follows:
```
wayland 1.22.0
wayland-protocols 1.32
xwayland 23.2.0
hyprland 0.29.1
hyprland-protocols 0.2
xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland 0.5.0
wlroots 0.16.2-r1
libdrm 2.4.116
mesa 23.2.0_rc3 (built with gles2)
```

### How to reproduce

1. Install Gentoo (good luck)
2. Follow the instructions from the wiki
```
emerge --ask gui-wm/hyprland
emerge --ask gui-libs/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
eselect repository enable guru
emaint sync -r guru
emerge --ask gui-apps/hyprland-plugins
emerge --ask gui-apps/hyprpaper
emerge --ask gui-apps/hyprpicker
emerge --ask gui-wm/hyprland-contrib
```
3. Launch from an X session in the terminal - happy result
4. Go to TTY
5. `dbus-run-session Hyprland` - sad result
6. Select the Hyprland session in sddm or other display manager - even sadder result

1904,Rendering fails with external monitor,"to reproduce
- set up hyprland
- plug it in to external monitor
- configure like so:
```
monitor = DP-1, preferred, 0x0, auto  # <-- external
workspace=DP-1,1
monitor=eDP-1, preferred, 835x1440, auto
workspace=eDP-1, 9
workspace=eDP-1, 10
```

### Expected outcome
hyprland, but with a second screen

### Noted outcome
If I try to do anything on a workspace assigned to the external monitor (e.g. open the special workspace, change to another workspace on the external monitor), the monitor...freezes, I guess?

If I change focus to my laptop screen (either with the mouse or by changing to a workspace assigned to the laptop screen), then change focus back to the monitor, the expected changes are rendered.",0

2456,Opacity doesn't change for class 'Spotify',"oo...as the title says, idk for some weird reason, the Spotify app doesn't get affect by the opacity function even after putting it in the config file, yes i have used `hyprctl clients` to fetch the class info and thats what it says its class name is ""Spotify"".

Steps to reproduce: 
1) set the opacity for Spotify in the config file
2) open Spotify

my guesses are that either the class for Spotify is wrong or its something to do with Spotify's way of displaying things

and yeah, i've downloaded spotify from AUR

Thanks in advance!

1611,Random hangs on latest NixOS,"ve the logs for this issue because this is not a crash. After updating to the latest NixOS unstable and updating the kernel to 6.3, Hyprland got really unstable. At some points in time, it hangs for a solid 5 minutes before starting again. I am also unable to access tty in the middle of this.

Switching back to a previous NixOS iteration fixes this. I am unsure if it is caused by NixOS or a regression in Hyprland",0

585,XWayland connection permanently dies at random occasions,"

Hello, I’ve encountered an unusual problem, and I’m not sure if it’s related to Hyprland or EndeavourOS. My setup includes an NVIDIA RTX 4090 and I’m running Hyprland on EndeavourOS. I can open applications and they work normally, but specific actions cause issues. For example, in Opera, when I attempt to open a file selection dialog or use drag-and-drop features, the application unexpectedly closes. This issue isn’t limited to Opera; it also affects other applications like Google Chrome and Java apps, but not my terminal windows or Firefox. Additionally, when I try to open virtual machines in VirtualBox, it triggers a stack trace. Here are the details of the stack trace.

To open again all the applications, I need reboot the system.

### How to reproduce

1349,[force_zero_scaling] Context menus open first in the wrong place,"

Opening a XWayland context menu when using `force_zero_scaling`, it shows up in the wrong place. If I close and reopen it, the menu appears in the correct place.

### How to reproduce

- Open Steam with force_zero_scaling
- try to open a context menu
- observe wrong place
- close and reopen
- observe correct place

1916,Hyprland becomes unstable with multiple monitors,"ately was unable to collect any logs, but I noticed that sometimes hyprland can become unstable when connected to a second monitor. I was moving a waterfox window around, and it stopped responding properly and never properly adjusted to the new size. It eventually terminated the process, and then something (be it Hyprland or waterfox) sprung a memory leak and used all 20 GB of RAM, rendering my system useless untill I force-restarted it. I understand this isn't useful without adding any logs, so I'm going to try to mess around with it more and then collect some logs.

Unless Hyprland stores extra logs somewhere that I'm not aware of",0
1718,XWayland applications get keystrokes after compositor-level keybind,"ging workspaces, XWayland clients seem to get the input from the final key in the keybind. Wayland apps work properly and don't get that input. 

It's a bit tough to see from the video but what I'm doing is pressing Meta+3 and holding them down for a while.

1774,10 bit monitor enabled - Screen Sharing wont work,"actly a bug but you may want to add into your documentation.

Regarding 10 bit support, even if monitor does not support but if enabled in Monitor config, OBS screen sharing wont work. 

And even Monitor support 10bit, if enabled, OBS screen sharing wont work.

I believe this is more on wayland kind of issue and not exactly Hyprland.

This is testing on my laptop (Asus G15) and Desktop with monitor Odyssey G",0
2090,Previous workspace is forgotten or cycles too far,"es to when `binds:allow_workspace_cycles` is set to `false`:

The `workspace previous` command is not working as I'd expect.  I'm using the master layout (though the code seems to generically apply to all) and I would expect `workspace previous` always to return to the previous workspace (the one I was on before switching), effectively allowing me to toggle between my last two workspaces indefinitely. Instead, I find that cycling to the previous workspace is no longer possible after I used it once.

observed behaviour:

```
workspace 1 -> ok
workspace 2 -> ok
workspace 3 -> ok
workspace previous -> takes me to 2, ok
workspace previous -> takes me to 1, not ok, I have allow_workspace_cycles disabled
workspace previous -> takes me to 3 (why now?)
workspace previous -> no action, keeps me at 3
.. stuck at 3..
```

expected behaviour:

```
workspace 1
workspace 2
workspace 3
workspace previous -> takes me to 2
workspace previous -> takes me to 3
workspace previous -> takes me to 2
workspace previous -> takes me to 3
..repeat ad infinitum..
```

Note:

Though all of this is on a single monitor, I do run a multi-monitor setup with workspace 10 (and only 10) on the second monitor. I haven't switched to it in the above tests but can't rule out that multi-monitor is somehow a factor in this bug",0

45,Some weird rendering issues with the special workspace.,"

When I am on the special workspace and I move a window from the special workspace to a regular workspace, the special workspace becomes invisible and not accessible until I move a window to the special workspace.

### How to reproduce

1. Open windows in the special workspace.
2. Move one of those special windows to a regular workspace.
3. To make the special workspace visible and usable again, move the window back to the special workspace.

1042,wl_compositor v6 advertised but scale is not reported,"

It was brought to me that examples stopped scaling, however this is because we use `v6` of `wl_compositor` **when compositor advertises it**.

Hyprland seem to advertise it, thus we bind and expect the scaling event to arrive. However, hyprland never sends scaling, even though the output has a scale of 2.

The issue is available there https://github.com/Smithay/client-toolkit/issues/423

2105,Weird bug after using special workspace,"the latest git master of Hyprland on Arch Linux with a dual screen setup.
If I open a foot terminal ( latest git ) which opens using a rule on workspace 2 and then send it to the special workspace.
Then I move to workspace 1 and open Qutebrowser it does not open on workspace 1 but opens up in the special workspace alongside the foot terminal which was sent there.
I also notice if i then move Qutebrowser back to workspace 1 then my foot terminal disapears and i can no longer open terminals. But if before closing the special workspace i also move foot back to workspace 2 it vanishes but i can make it come back by moving to say workspace 3 then back to 2 and it reapears.
If i do not use the special work spaces and open foot on 2 and Qutebrowser on 1 then everything is fine.
Not sure what's going on there and hope someone else can reproduce it too ",0

As described in #3079 wlroots bump causes a weird behavior on my system too, but is present even with the default config `monitor=,preferred,auto,auto`.
I use my laptop display and one external monitor, the issue described in #3079 affects my external monitor only. It happens even with the default configuration generated by Hyprland.

As @ferrreo mentioned the bug seems to be introduced by the commit `717ded9b`, I tested reverting wlroots back to `7bf6c1fc` and compiling again, as said it fixes the previous issue but now my Laptop screen is completely white and without response, the work around to get my laptop display back was toggle dpms status using `hyprctl`.

Also reverting wlroots back to `7bf6c1fc` also freezes Hyprland when I edit and save the configuration, leaving me no choice than close Hyprland with `Mod+m`, that not happens when building wlroots from commit `717ded9b`.

### How to reproduce

Compile Hyprland from commit `0a78f60` and wlroots from commit `7bf6c1fc` launch with default config and observe the issue described above.

When I go to login I get a black screen and it goes back to the login page.  The last thing I did to hyprland was update hyprland-nvidia-git using yay. One thing to note is that if I use hyprland-nvidia (no git at the end) I still get this bug. Sorry for lack of info if there is anything more needed please tell me.

### How to reproduce

1. Get the same PC set up to me (look at neofetch).
2. Turn on PC.
3. Let arch linux boot (using GRUB).
4. Type in password.
5. Screen goes black and you get sent to the log in page again.

1122,Mouse cursor getting detached from where it actually is,"

Since yesterday, when I am doing anything that causes a floating window (right click, save file, popup message), the windows will stop responding to mouse input. The mouse actions will not work until I either switch workspaces and back, or if I move my mouse over certain elements (text box usually works) and keep clicking it seems to eventually correct itself. 

At one time, I can confirm the mouse was actually interacting with a separate workspace than the one which was on my screen. I had a fullscreen video paused on another workspace, and when I was clicking it was unpausing and pausing that video.

### How to reproduce

Open a right click context menu, or a floating popup window

After the last update, windows no longer open in the center of the screen with `windowrule=center,^(window_class)$`. Not sure what is causing the problem, everything worked fine yesterday with the same config. Works fine on 555afea73c87f8e2bb374d1112431bb3a6f451dd

677,smart_split incorrect direction of new windows when hovering over reserved area,"

When `dwindle:smart_split=1` is set, hovering over reserved area (such a waybar) at the bottom of the screen creates windows towards top and not towards bottom.

### How to reproduce

1. have waybar at the bottom
2. set `dwindle:smart_split=1`
3. create a new window
3. hover over waybar
4. create a second window

Actual:
the second window is created at the top of the screen

486,[Glitches] Hyprland doesn't play well with Telegram Desktop (or QT?),"ed if this is Telegram Desktop's fault or if this happens only with Hyprland/Wayland sessions. But seems like it's not happening on Sway.

I thought it was an animation bug, but by disabling them it looks like that the bugs becomes even more persisting. At the moment, the only way to get back to the normal window state is by changing workspace or switching to full-screen. Looks like this is a bug present even on [qterminal](https://github.com/lxqt/qterminal), so it may be an issue that affects some QT programs.

## How to reproduce
Reproducing differentiates between applications, but in the case of Telegram:
* Open the application
* Open a photo/video via the Media Viewer
* Try over and over until it glitches out
With `animations:enabled=0`, instead, the glitch appears every time the Media Viewer pops-up.

395,Hyprland keeps hyprctl connections open after `dispatch exec`,"
`.socket.sock` is not closed after `dispatch exec` command has completed. Basically as long dispatched command is running socket will stay open. Which means there is no reliable way to work with this socket, `hyprctl` for example just tries to read 8192 bytes, and quits, and it is not how you are supposed to work with socket. You need to read from it until it reads zero bytes, this is how you make sure there is nothing left to read.

## What is going on
I did some digging it looks like, those connections are kept alive because they are inherited by the spawned process. Which means even tough it is closed on the hyprland side it is kept open by the child process.

## How to fix
All socket must be `CLOEXEC` by either:
 - `fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)`
 - or during creation with `SOCK_CLOEXEC",0

2345,(NixOS) Newest Hyprland update gives no output," updating from 0.11.1 to 0.12.1 (using the nix flake version of Hyprland) I get 0 output to the screen, at all. Hyprland *does* still run, doesn't crash, and applications run inside it (considering I still get audio output) but I've been unable to get any output at all on either my internal laptop display or external monitor.

I am using Nvidia's proprietary drivers (with the open source modules) and a patched wlroots for Hyprland to work properly w/ Nvidia drivers. The last version of Hyprland to work for me is `0.11.1beta+date=2022-08-29_179562b`.

Steps to reproduce:
* Update to the latest version of Hyprland.
* Run Hyprland.

Expected outcome:
* Audio and video both work normally.

Noted outcome:
* Audio continues to work as normal, but video is completely non-working",0
185,Swipe gesture doesn't respect animation disable,"

Swipe animation (trackpad gesture swipe) is not disabled with animations disabled. This appears to be an oversight, or possibly just deemed a requirement as it's a gesture. If so, would a fade out of the current workspace into the new workspace be a sane default? MacOS does this for their motion reduction mode as it can cause users to get motion sickness. On this note, if an animation must happen, the sudden snap at the end is quite jarring, and should likely be given a smooth animation finish instead of a snap when you are past the cancel ratio.

### How to reproduce

Enable gestures, disable animation. Example partial config in nix

```nix
    gestures = {
      workspace_swipe = true;
      workspace_swipe_fingers = 3;
      workspace_swipe_cancel_ratio = 0.01;
      workspace_swipe_distance = 2000;
      workspace_swipe_invert = true;
    };
    animations.enabled = false;
```

2048,New crash: disabling monitor twice crashes Hyprland after first toggle. Happens since at least ddcae74,"ng version: ddcae74e09ade4215da537791e10ee229e4e3f7d This issue is not present.
A commit between then and the 2.0 milestone seems to introduce it. Perhaps: a33ecec61ef4c5749a17f52b15f0e0d0722b1f3d. Will try if you say it helps you.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Start hyperland with external monitor attached. Mine is called `LVDS-1`.
2. disable laptop/internal screen with `hyprctl keyword monitor LVDS-1,disable`
3. enable again with: `hyprctl keyword monitor LVDS-1,pref,auto,auto`
4. disable again with `hyprctl keyword monitor LVDS-1,disable`


### Expected outcome
Hyperland simply disables the monitor again.

### Noted outcome
Hyprland crashes everytime on the second disable, never the first.

1000,Crash on re-open lid / resume of laptop,"

Hi there, just doing my duty to log this!

I had a Hyprland crash when re-opening my laptop lid (it was previously turned on and running Hyprland).
The screen flickered and graphical bugs (patterned random colours) happened.
Then Hyprland crashed and sent me back to my TTY.

Here are some system details

1571,XWayland Apps Not Accepting Mouse Input,"rted to use Hyprland and was moving over my Sway config when at a certain point all XWayland apps stopped accepting mouse input, though keyboard input was still working. Tried restarting Hyprland and using the latest master branch via the [hyprland-git AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hyprland-git). Unfortunately to no avail. Unsure what else to tell you. Verified that it's an XWayland specific issue as VS Code in XWayland has the issue, running it with Wayland native enabled does not have the issue. Also verified it with `xwininfo`.

2,Add cmake install target,"### Description

Currently it seems like the makefile is used for the install target even though ninja is used via cmake in the makefile.
I think it would make more sense to add a cmake install target so that you can do this:
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

This would also benefit the use case of customizing cmake features such as `-DNO_XWAYLAND=ON` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel` without having to modify the makefile. This also impacts setting custom compilers and/or compiler flags.",1
3,Binding to unlock the mouse when it is hidden / confined by a window,"### Description

So, some video games and other applications steal your mouse for the sake of letting you control the camera. In other applications one might alt-tab or something, however in hyprland if you mouse even touches the window it gets stolen again. Normally I want the hovered window to be active, but for windows that steal the mouse that is less so.

It would be neat to make it so that if I held the windows key (or any other binding), the mouse would always appear and not be stolen by a window and let me move the mouse without _any_ window being active. That would allow me to move it to another window without consequence, and then releasing the key would then go back to the old behaviour. This could also allow me to move and resize the window without it necessarily being 'active'.

This would also be useful for windows where the mouse cannot be moved out of the window, and probably some other use cases.

I know that you can use the keyboard to move the mouse out of the window, but in some situations this is annoying. Say a game defaults to floating mode and full screen AND steals your mouse, you kind of just have to de-float it and hope it allows that. This new feature would allow me to move the window and resize it and organise my windows without worrying about the application trying to take control of my mouse.

For NVIDIA users like me this is really important since it gets rid of lot of flickering and artifacts in apps like Steam and Spotify and a bunch of games, since the driver lacks support for implicit synchronization. Thanks a lot for the awesome work you've done here, and I hope this can be implemented soon!",1
9,Window rule to force windows above top layer components,"### Description

Since not-so-long flameshot came with wlroots-based compositor support, on hyprland with some window rules (see [this comment](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/2978#issuecomment-1931911097)). However, bars like waybar appear above the window when `layer` is set to `top`. I would like to have a window rule to make windows appear above the `top` layer. Would this be possible, and if so, would you be interested in making it?  

Additional info:  
Use `flameshot-git` from the AUR, or the source-compile the latest commit of flameshot for wlroots-support to work.

I would like to be able to do the following: `hyprctl keyword windowrule move 50%-20 0`

However, this way of specifying the offset only works when using 100% as the percentage value, as documented in the [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/#static-rules):
```
move [x] [y]	moves a floating window (x,y -> int or %, e.g. 20% or 100. You are also allowed to do 100%- for the right/bottom anchor, e.g. 100%-20). Additionally, you can also do cursor [x] [y] where x and y are either pixels or percent. Percent is calculated from the window’s size. Specify onscreen before other parameters to force the window into the screen (e.g. move onscreen cursor 50% 50%)

I tried accomplishing this using the relative monitor ID option, but afaik there's no way to manually define the order that it cycles through the monitors with this method (if there is then that would also solve my problem)",1
14,New 'pin' event,"### Description

An IPC event that is dispatched when a window is pinned would be very useful. Right now there is no way (afaik) to know a window's pinned status changed.",1
15,windowrule 'move' to use 'direction' parameter type,"### Description

Would it be possible to use `direction` parameter type (used in dispatchers) in `move` windowrule?

### Reason:
It would be very helpful to set up window rule to snap a hovering (floating and pinned) window to any corner, without calculating pixel-perfect position for the window (with the border/without the border; border size what etc.) from the user side.

### Example of possible usage:
Currently I am using a windowrule to resize and hover firefox picture-in-picture windows, like this:
```
windowrulev2 = size 30% 30%, title:^(Picture-in-Picture)$
windowrulev2 = move 100%-30%-3 100%-30%-3, title:^(Picture-in-Picture)$
```

There is another variation of the rule, which does not keep space for border in right and bottom side:
```
windowrulev2 = move 100%-30% 100%-30%, title:^(Picture-in-Picture)$
```

The problem is, if border_size is changed, every instance of this type of rule has to be updated manually.

But if `direction` parameter could be used, then the rule would be like this.
```
windowrulev2 = move r d, title:^(Picture-in-Picture)$
```
No extra calculation for whether the border would be included or not, and what is the size of the border etc.",1
16,Ability to contain user interaction with window size,"### Description

Some windows just don't look right when they are tiled, very large or very small, so it would be nice to have a way of doing this:
- Set the maximum possible size for floating window. At the moment (as far as I can see in docs) there is only a static `maxsize` rule which only affects window creation, user is still able to resize the window more than this. I tried to find the upper limit, but Hyprland just crashed at 40000x40000.
- Set minimum possible size for floating window, same as before, but right now minimum size is at least exist - it is 20x20 window, just point on screen.  Can it be customized globally and per window?

- Same issue for tiling windows with use case examples https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/4414

- Add window rule that allows always floating window (set float and ignore togglefloating dispatcher, even if user accidentally press it). I guess it can be done with bash script, but window rule is more convenient.

17,Stdout access for an each and every app launched inside hyprland.,"### Description

Lets say we launched something via exec or exec-once. Or we could launch an app through a dedicated dispatcher (that we would hook up to i.e. to rofi). We want an easy access to output of that app but we don't want to always see that output. What if we could attach and detach, on demand for that output via hyprctl?
What if we want to comfortably, on demand debug i.e. hypridle? ;)

18,New Windows Rules to help work around issues with poor client design causing bad behavior,"### Description

This is in relation to how steam functions as a piece of software, and the issues present with its asinine way of handling its top context menu windows (they really shouldn't be windows in the first place)

the `stayfocused` rule isn't a functional fix for those who have follow_mouse set to 2 in the input tag. and I don't usually want to focus on a window until I'm ready for it. However in the context of most steam windows i am ready for it.

That said `stayfocued` option also creates other undesirable issues, namely i cant flip between windows when something has stay focused being active, which creates the issue i tend to run into when looking up launch options - i tend to flip between the launch options dialogue and my browser so i can look up the options i need, and having `stayfocused` enabled prevents this. 

Here are my requests:

-  add a toggle in hyprctl or option to disable or toggle `stayfocused` on the focused window via a bind dispatcher. This is a band aid solution at best, and wont solve my issue of follow_mouse, but it will allow me to escape stayfocused when needed.
 - A window rule that, upon window creation forcibly warps the mouse to be centered on that window - even if its a special window such as one of steams top context menus.
 - A second window rule that allows us to apply follow_mouse = 0, 1,2 or 3 to specific window classes, overriding our current value for those windows only - this should allow `stayfocused` to work with steam if we cant find an alternative (or the above mouse movement rule doesn't work)
 
We could combine these rules if we wanted as well.

Hopefully being able to do these two things can allow us to better work around steams asinine method of using windows as top context menus and the issues it causes.",1

22,Control window floating rules with hyprctl,"### Description

Hi!

I would like to set some window to always float. Of course, I can add a window rule to a config, but I do not want to bloat it for every class I need. Rather, I want some script that reads a window class name and executes `hyprctl` command for it.

## What I considered
* `hyprctl dispatch togglefloat` - I don't need to toggle, I run this script multiple times
* workspace with all-floating windows - I need a workspace with both floating and not-floating windows

I need this also for centering, but for that I have `hyprctl dispatch centerwindow`

Am I missing something here? I am thinking of some weird hacks, but maybe there is a clearer solution? Thanks!",1

27,`inactive_border_size` or some other way to disable inactive border,"### Description

Currently, you can *sort of* disable inactive borders by setting `col.inactive_border = rgba(00000000)`. However, if you use shadows, then this leaves a jarring space where there is no shadow around the window. I propose an `inactive_border_size` option under `general`, which would let you control their size independently with the option to completely disable by setting to `0`.

If for some reason this would be much more difficult than simply adding a `disable_inactive_border` toggle, then that's all I really care about anyway and would be happy to see either added!

28,Anamorphic scaling,"### Description

In some cases, worth setting up anamorphic scaling, like when you're using an NTSC like CRT and setting up output models to deal with. The pixel clock for the horizontal resolution needs to be at least double the original horizontal resolution to have the proper timing for the blanking interval. So, you could have unusual output modes like
1440x240. To obtain the 720x480 output from that mode, you need to scale the horizontal resolution in half while scaling double the vertical resolution.
On X11, the scaling works well. You can play around on X11 using the Python script [chvideo.py](https://github.com/cjuniorfox/retropie-crt/blob/main/resources/usr/bin/chvideo.py) that I wrote originally for the Raspberry Pi but works ok on X11 if you add the '-m' flag.

30,Assign workspaces to monitor IDs,"### Description

I am using Hyprland on my laptop and frequently plug in and out different external monitor setups. My preferred way of managing workspaces is like the Awesome window manager, each monitor gets their own several (10) workspaces to switch between.

I managed to make that work with binding a range of workspaces to monitor names, and having a script that switches the workspaces groups based on the focused monitor. For example, I bound worspaces 1 to 10 to eDP-1, and workspaces 101 to 110 to HDMI-A-1. I then use the id of the focused monitor to switch between the hundred digits.

However, when I plug in a monitor via usb-c, this does not work anymore, since the id of the external monitor is still 2, but the name is different (DP-1). The same happens when I plug two or more monitors.

I would like to be able to bind workspaces to the ID of the monitor, since they can be seen as 'the first external monitor' and 'the second external monitor', not the output port of the monitor. 

It would thus be nice if I was able to do something like this:
```
workspace = 1, monitor: 0, default:true
workspace = 2, monitor: 0
...
workspace = 101, monitor:1, default:true
workspace = 102, monitor: 1
...

31,Warp cursor only when focusing a different monitor,"### Description

Sway features the variable `mouse_warping`, with options `output`, `container` and `none`, defaulting to `output`. I find the `output` behaviour to be the most intuitive: the cursor is warped to the centre of the monitor when focusing a different monitor, but not when focusing a different window. The `container` option matches what Hyprland does by default.

Now, Hyprland does feature the variable `no_cursor_warps`, but the switch is only between `container` and `none`. How would I achieve behaviour similar to that of Sway?",1
32, libinput send events configuration,"### Description

Hello. I'm currently looking into Sway alternatives, and find that all other WMs out there do not support the libinput [Send Events Mode](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/configuration.html#send-events-mode) setting.

It allows to automatically disable the touchpad when external mouse is connected, and enable it again when mouse is disconnected. I find it very useful, instead of manually disabling and enabling touchpad via hotkeys.

The example of this setting configuration in Sway: 
https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/sway/input/libinput.c#L222
https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/sway/input/libinput.c#L19

From sway-input man:
````
input <identifier> events enabled|disabled|disabled_on_external_mouse|toggle [<toggle-modes>]

Enables or disables send_events for specified input device.
Disabling send_events disables the input device.
The toggle option cannot be used in the config.
If no toggle modes are listed, all supported modes for the device will be toggled through in the order: 
enabled, disabled_on_external_mouse, disabled, (loop back). 
If toggle modes are listed, they will be cycled through, 
defaulting to the first mode listed if the current mode is not in the list. 
They will also not be checked to see if they are supported for the device and may fail.

Is it possible to support this libinput setting in hyprland?

34,Mouse Binding Similar to dwm,"### Description

Hello, I recently switched from dwm to hyprland and I'm having some issues with the mouse bindings.

In dwm, I used the following mouse bindings:
 { ClkClientWin, MODKEY, Button1, movemouse, {0} }, // super+left click | Drag window | Drag window 
{ ClkClientWin, MODKEY, Button3, resizemouse, {0} }, // super+right click | Drag window | Resize window

In hyprland, I'm using the following mouse bindings:
bindm = $mainMod, mouse:272, movewindow
bindm = $mainMod, mouse:273, resizemouse

I have two points of confusion:

1. In dwm, I used super+left mouse click to drag windows. When I dragged a tiled window, it would become a floating window. However, in hyprland, the movewindow command does not make the window float.

2. In dwm, I used super+right mouse click to resize windows. When I dragged the window using the right mouse button, it would always resize the window from the bottom right corner. This feature made it easy for me to reset the window size. However, in hyprland, it adjusts the window size relative to the position of the window border, which I believe adds unnecessary complexity.

How can I adjust the mouse binding logic in hyprland to match that of dwm? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1
35,Scaling animation tweaking,"### Description

So what i get now, the animation works in such a way that it crops excess detail and stretches the output is it's not enough.

This, however, creates some visual inconsistencies, main of them being windows stretching the smaller version when scaled down, resulting in some ""flickering"".

---

What i suggest instead is offering ways to deal with it (or embrace it).
You could scale the window down late, so when the resizing animation plays it uses the larger version and no streching occurs.
There can also be reverse behavior, so that when scaling up it stretches the smaller version, if anyone prefers that.

You could also introduce ""strict mode"" - actually fitting window to the current render size as much as possible, interpolating the occasional render gaps.

If taking it to the limit, these could also be made into a windowrule.",1
36,Screencopy security,"### Description

As it is, users might have the false impression that sandboxed flatpak apps have no access to your whole screen, and have to be authorized via the xdph dialog to have that access.

However, any graphical program (that has thus access to the wayland socket) can just invoke the screencopy protocol directly. There should be some form of check for this, as this current state is arguably worse than X11, where there at least were sandboxing solutions like in firejail that prevented this.
Also people knew this was a problem in X11, but are kind of deceived to think wayland secures them against this kind of problem.

In sway, this is an issue as well, but I haven't seen any progress on this in years.

There should be some solution to only allow some clients access to the screencopy or the export_dmabuf protocol.",1
37,Overlaying windows over lockscreen,"### Description

Hey there,
I really like hyprland and dailly-drive it both on my PC and phone, the latter of which is causing me a bit of an annoyance.
I'd like to open windows like e.g. gnome-calls regardless of the lockscreen being open or not, which is what I'm requesting here: I want to be able to allow certain applications to launch in front of the lockscreen, while the rest of the system is still locked. I want to for example be able to take calls, or control media via the display, without having to log into hyprland.

Obviously there are security implications. My idea would be to only allow windows matching a certain regex to be displayed in front of the lockscreen. This would prevent anyone from e.g. opening the file picker to snoop around the files on the device. Functionality wise, you could maybe treat the lockscreen similarly to the the wallpaper layer  (while allowing you to focus it, and enter your password), and just put a single, immovable workspace in front of it, for which all the known keybinds work, meaning you can just tile windows on the lockscreen, for example your media player, to have immediate access to the controls. Useful would also be if you could remap certain keybinds from the normal environment: You could for example map your launcher keybind to a command that only shows certain applications/actions.

Hyprland has a lot of these whacky and useful features so I doubt this wouldn't fit it. The question is, how many people would use it. It would definitely be on its own, since a feature like this doesn't seem to exist anywhere (yet).

An alternative would be a new screenlocker that is much more flexible and allows you to do things like these, but I think that would be beyond the scope of this project.

I'd be very happy if this made it into hyprland! So, is this idea usable?

40,pass all bindings to focused application,"### Description

when connecting to Virtual Machines i would like to pass various key combinations to the vm without interfering with the binds in my config.
Easiest solution for this would be to configure applications to which ALL combinations should be passed to and make exception rules.

eg.:
```
passthrough = virt-viewer
# idk if this is possibly without major changes
virt-viewer[e] = SUPER_SHIFT,Q

# maybe even just this
passthrough = virt-viewer, SUPER_SHIFT,Q

# or somehow extend the bind keyword 
```

Or maybe an inner circle of validity of keybinds, where applications can be flagged so all combinations would be inserted into it when its focused. And the bind keyword would get a new flag to describe binds of an inner circle that would make the exceptions.

42,[Enhancement] Anchor surface drawing to resized corner to alleviate wobbles when resizing,"### Description

When resizing a window, the contents get stretched until the program catches up with the resize and provides a properly-sized surface. This works, but causes a visible wobble in elements as the resize happens, and is not very visually pleasing.

I saw this recently merged pull request for the sokol-gfx macOS Metal backend that solves this in a pretty smart way, and I think it'd be cool to see a similar solution implemented in Hyprland: https://github.com/floooh/sokol/pull/963
The drawing is anchored to a different point depending on which corner of the window is being dragged. The videos in the PR show the issue, which also happens on Hyprland. It's especially noticeable with apps that are slow to redraw, such as `foot` running `btop` resizing to the right.

An example use-case is cycling between instances of an application via a taskbar widget using the mouse - every time a window is focussed, the mouse warps away from the taskbar widget to the center of focussed window. In this case I would like to have the user scroll-wheel through all instances of an application, but the current cursor warping makes this is impossible.",1
52,Cursor Visibility Settings,"# Description
This feature gives the user the option to adjust the cursor’s visibility according to their preference. The user can choose one of the following settings:

-   **Hide the cursor** when no apps are running on the screen. This can help reduce distractions and improve ricing attempts.
-   **Hide the cursor only for specific apps** that the user selects. This can be useful for apps that do not require cursor input.

The cursor will automatically reappear when the user opens an app that is not on the hidden list.

53,Independent Touchpad Acceleration Profile 2,"### Description

### Hyprland Version
built from branch  at commit v0.32.3   ().

### Main Issue
original: #898 
Make it easy to bring hyprland config to new devices with touchpads.

### Solutions
Two options: 
1. Wildcard device rules: would allow for:
```
device:*-touchpad { 
  accel_profile = adaptive
}
```
2. Allow the following:
```
input {
  accel_profile = flat # mouse/other
  touchpad {
    accel_profile = adaptive
  }
}
```

Current process feels bad. You need to find the device name and add it to config and have copy-pasted config for every touchpad you use.
### Current Solution Example
```
device:########:######:##1-touchpad {
  accel_profile = adaptive
}
device:########:######:##2-touchpad {
  accel_profile = adaptive
}
device:########:######:##3-touchpad {
  accel_profile = adaptive
}
device:########:######:##4-touchpad {
  accel_profile = adaptive
}
```

54,Keybinds for non-mouse/keyboards,"### Description

There is currently no way for making a keybind for remotes/controller/touch/pen, as all events triggered only look for keyboard and or mouse events. I'd like to suggest expanding the functionality to support all device inputs.

Here is an example of code and keycode not recognized by hyprland (This is from libinput):

```
Event: time 1702058911.784149, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 262 (BTN_6), value 1
Event: time 1702058911.784149, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 40 (ABS_MISC), value 15
Event: time 1702058911.784149, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 0 (MSC_SERIAL), value 151741
```

This feature would allow to make keybindings for pens/remotes. For example, in my usage case it would allow to press a pens button to switch monitor output. Or use the remote for shortcuts in applications like Blender.",1
55,Replace windowrule with windowrulev2.,"### Description

I really enjoy using Hyprland and love how configurable it is. However, I'm confused by the fact that there are two versions of windowrule in config: windowrule (V1) and windowrulev2 (V2). V2 is simply better. It is more flexible, while remaining intuitive. So wouldn't it be better to replace V1 with V2? If not, why?",1

58,Shell autocomplete support,"### Description

Please add support for bash (& possibly other shells like zsh and fish) completion support. It would be incredibly useful for people who things like zsh-autocomplete, are used to tabbing commands, or are still learning hyprland and how to use hyprctl. This is obviously _not_ a high priority feature, but it's a great quality of life addition, and would surely be appreciated by those without the best memory (such as myself).

When asking for support for other programs, I would usually do something like linking to their documentation, but the [documentation for bash](https://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html) is certainly dated to say the least. [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html) is only a little bit better, though [fish's documentation](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/completions.html) is very helpful.",1

60,toggle window history,"### Description

I have seen
```
bind= ALT, Tab, workspace, m+1        # next workspace
bind= ALT Shift, Tab, workspace, m-1  # previous workspace
```
recently, and this works nicely.
And it would be nice, however, to have
```
bind= ALT, Tab, workspace, h-1         # back in history
bind= ALT Shift, Tab, workspace, h+1   # forward
```
to toggle the history of workspaces back- and forth, or
```
bind= ALT, Tab, window, h+1            # window history
bind= ALT Shift, Tab, window, h-1

Why is it important? Because `alt+tab` can be comfortably run with one, the _left_ hand only. This is often better than regular window or workspace switching keybinds.",1
61,Per-Window Scaling,"### Description

I'd like to be able to set custom scaling for specific windows. In other words: I'd like to be able to use different Wayland scaling multipliers between individual windows within the same workspace.

I feel that such a feature would improve workspace management when using applications which support Wayland scaling but otherwise lack a built-in ""zoom"" mechanism. The value-add would come from being able to fit otherwise unreasonably bulky applications into a given workspace layout without sacrificing unacceptable amounts of screen real-estate.

Off the top of my head, I can imagine the following possible implementations:

**A.** As a dispatcher (e.g.: `scalewindow +0.2` / `scalewindow exact 2.0`) -- does the spec allow for changing scale on the fly?
**B.** As a window rule (e.g.: `scale 2.0` / `scale 0.5`) ",1

The description about `bool` type in the wiki
> boolean, true or false (yes or no, on or off, 0 or 1) - any numerical value that is not 0 or 1 will cause undefined behavior.

Here, I think the program should explicitly report an error rather than causing an undefined behavior when the given value is a numerical value that is not 0 or 1. UB should not be exposed to users.

Causing error is much better than causing UB in terms of user experience. Moreover, UB is a potential security vulnerability.",1

67,"When moving windows to another workspace, split it with last focused window on that workspace and respect force_split","### Description

I use dwindle layout, and have force_split=2 enabled. But I can't determine what is the rule and how are windows placed when you move them across workspaces.

When having one window on that workspace, after moving another window to it, it sometimes get placed on the left, sometimes on the right. 

When you have two windows and bringing another one, it gets placed on top/bottom depending on mouse cursor location ignoring force_split=2 which should force right-bottom. 
Also I cannot determine if it will split with the left window or right window, it doesn't follow last focused window.

I think it would be reasonable to split the moved window with last focused on that workspace and respecting force_split behavior  instead of relying on mouse position.

71,Additional parameters for group dispatchers ,"### Description

Dispatchers: moveintogroup, moveoutofgroup and movewindoworgroup currently support directional parameters.

It could be beneficial for these dispatchers to accept an address parameter, allowing specific management of windows in and out of groups via hyprctl. This could provide a tailored workflow experience within hyprland's framework.

Additionally, it could be useful to have further management of the dispatcher: changegroupactive with the possibility of selecting between grouped windows in a style similar to the management of workspaces, ie. Mod+Shift+2 to select the second window in a group.

73,"add x, y, height & width values to clients hyprctl output","### Description

Whilst these fields are available in clients output as ""at"" and ""size"" arrays, it would be good for there to be consistency between how the size of a monitor and a client window is defined. There are a number of differences between data formatsin in workspaces, clients and monitors, which ideally should be harmonized.

Further to this it could be useful (and a potential justification for adding otherwise ""identical"" data) to provide client coordinates relative to the monitor they are on, rather than absolute ones. This is clearly possible to calculate after the event though.",1

### Bug or Regression?

Bug

### Description

Using the `windowrule = dimaround,WINDOW` will dim all other applications around `WINDOW`, as expected. However, spawning more than *one* instance of `WINDOW` causes the dimming boxes on other applications to compound. It causes the dimming on other applications to become darker with each new instance of `WINDOW` that is created.

The bug is present on both `windowrule` & `windowrulev2`.

Platform: Arch Linux x86_64

77,Split monitor into virtual outputs,"### Description

[Sway has already covered this issue quite extensively](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/1666#issuecomment-1356871296).

The idea is that you can split an (ultrawide) monitor into multiple smaller virtual outputs.

Example: Instead of having a single 5440x1440 monitor, you could divide it into two 2560x1440 monitors or even a setup such as 1280x1440 + 2560x1440 + 1280x1440 monitor

This way you can switch between workspaces on different parts of the physical screen indepently of the rest of the screen.

## Proposal
* We currently have the `dpms` dispatcher, which turn on/off monitors without actually removing them from the layout.
* It would be worth adding the `monitor` dispatcher to turn on/off monitors actually removing them from the layout

##  Current workaround
One can already achieve this behavior by using hyprctl like this

```
# Note: Turning on/off monitors can cause waybar/hyprpaper to crash sometimes. 
#       To ensure they keep running, we restart them after turning on/off a monitor.

This would be useful, to create a graphical options menu (using somthing like eww). `hyprctl getoption` will retrieve the property value set in the hyprland configuration file, but not rules-based properties applied by hyprland at runtime based on a regex on window class or name.

85,"special ""exit-sub-on-exec"" bind for submaps and a wildcard key ","### Description

Related to #1972 I tried to get the same sort of keybinding I am used in sway.
1. I enter a submap with a certain keybind
2. I press a certain sub-bind
3. If this is defined execute it and exit the submap
4. If it doesn't exist, do not pass it as keypress but ignore the command and exit the submap

Right now, pressing the wrong key by accident in a terminal gets you some glyphs on the terminal.
Exiting the submap after an successful execution requires to define each key twice once for the acutal action and once to exit the submap.

I would like to propose two possible solutions

1. Define a bind for submaps which executes the action and exist the current submap
That alone would make it unnecessary to define an exit and might help a lot of people not to get locked in a submap.

2. Create a special ALL_KEYS / wildcard key which basically maps to all and every character. 
Creating at the very final end of a submap a binding with such a wildcard-key would allow to exit the submap without action and would avoid to pass any ""wrong"" entry as a key-press to the active program.

Both proposals would be backward compatible and do not change the submap mechanics, thus it could be implemented without conflicting with current configs.

90,Ignore fullscreen window on tiling layout,"### Description

It would be cool if there was an option that allowed me to ignore the fullscreened window on tiling layout, so then it wouldn't minimize my screen when i bring another window and it would still consider the new window that i brought as the first on the screen.

Similar to that!

91,Mouse grab/release dispatcher,"### Description

There seem to be a bug with mouse grabbing: https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3340

Regardless of it being fixed, in many cases a user may wish to temporarily lock mouse pointer to a window. Sometimes we also might need to forcefully release the mouse when a buggy app locks it.

It would be nice to have a new dispatcher, e.g. `grabmouse`, so users may do things  like

```
bind = $extMod, G, grabmouse, toggle
```

92,Event hooks in config,"### Description

I think it would be really useful to provide hooks for [Events](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Development/Event-list/) in the config.

```hypr
hook = << Event >>  , << any arguments valid to dispatchers >>
hook = monitorAdded , exec , notify-send ""Monitor"" ""Connected""
hook = monitorRemoved , exec , script/monitors.sh
hook = workspace , exec , hyprctl notify -1 10000 ""rgb(ff1ea3)"" ""!""
```
I know you could `socat` the hyprland socket and wait for said event ,
or even writing a plugin to do X.

But i think exposing a way to hook on to events in an easy way would be better.",1
93,Removing a window from a group repositions the group instead of the current window,"### Description

Possibly related to `group_focus_removed_window` not working? Not sure if this is just vaguely worded and actually addresses this functionality but I couldn't get that option working.

By default when you remove a window from a group by sending `moveoutofgroup`, I would expect the removed window to be removed and then re-added to the current workspace at the end. Instead, it leaves the window in place but removes the rest of the group and re-adds that to the end. 

I would think the behaviour is backwards, but in case there are people who prefer it that way it would be nice to have a config option for it (e.g. `keep_group_in_place_when_removing_child_window` default true).",1

I often find myself using picture in picture mode to watch YouTube videos whilst programming, and something I always hate is having to line up the pop-up perfectly!

99,Keybind to force ungrab the cursor,"### Description

I think it would be very useful if you had a way to forcefully ungrab the cursor from any window who grabbed it. Sometimes applications crash and take very long to ungrab the cursor, or fullscreen games grab the cursor and don't let it go, forcing you to tab to another window or switch workspaces (which all has it's downsides and is overall just pretty sloppy).

My idea is:
1. Application grabs cursor
2. Keybind ungrabs the cursor
3. When application is clicked, grab the cursor again
3. Alternative: When the application is focused again, grab the cursor (would need some workaround to make it functional with autofocus)",1
100,Focus follow mouse delay,"### Description

What I miss from DE's that implement 'Focus follows mouse' is the ability to set a delay for how much the mouse cursor has to hover over the window until it receives focus. This would be very useful to me as I find myself quite a lot of times using window and statusbar gaps in order to escape giving the focus to an unintended window, for example to then use my 'close' and 'maximize' button custom modules I made for myself in Waybar, to try to mimic my previous KDE layout.",1
101,Set workspace/monitor default master layout orientation,"### Description

I may have missed something but I have scoured the wiki for a solution to this and have been unable to find one. 

I use 2 monitors, one horizontal and one vertical. I would like to set the default orientation of the master layout to ""top"" on the vertical monitor and to ""left"" on the horizontal one.

I have added keybinds as a workaround. The issue is that I open several apps on startup and they all open with the wrong layout on my vertical monitor. I have to manually go into every workspace on that monitor and change the layout with the keybinds.

These are the keybinds I've set up:
```
bind = SUPER CTRL SHIFT, up, layoutmsg, orientationleft
bind = SUPER CTRL SHIFT, right, layoutmsg, orientationleft
bind = SUPER CTRL SHIFT, left, layoutmsg, orientationtop
bind = SUPER CTRL SHIFT, down, layoutmsg, orientationtop
```
These let me ""toggle"" between the two orientations. I have not found a way to use the layoutmsg dispatcher together with `exec-once`.

This is an example of two apps I open on startup:
```
exec-once = [workspace 1 silent] vscodium
exec-once = [workspace 1 silent] slack
```
I have not been able either to find a way to tell Hyprland to change the orientation to bottom before or after launching slack on workspace 1, for example.

Another solution (even nicer in my opinion) would be to be able to set a config so that all workspaces that spawn on a specific monitor are set to default to a specific layout. I have bound workspaces to the vertical monitor so having this config for the monitor would achieve the desired results.

**TLDR:** layoutmsg can be used to change the orientation of the master layout but the wiki only mentions how it can be used together with keybinds and does not mention how or if it can be used together with `exec-once`, a workspace rule or a monitor config.

Any ideas? If not, then maybe it's a good feature to request.",1
102,Add a feature for downscaling and upscaling the framebuffer resolution (Graphics Card scaling).,"### Description

I currently have a computer physically connected to my 4K TV and I share their screen using the Sunshine software with another computer using the Moonlight software, connected to an LG Ultrawide monitor.  Sunshine shares the Hyprland screen using ""wlroots"" and everything works okay but the difference between the screen's resolution and aspect ratio gives me black borders on the ultrawide monitor. Also, because my TV doesn't support the native resolution of my monitor (2560x1080), I can't set this as my output resolution, the ""modeline"" feature also didn't work and as far as I know, there's no way to use the Graphics Card framebuffer scaling on Hyprland. So I need to get back an X11 Window-Manger and set the Graphic's card framebuffer at the monitor's resolution (2560x1080) while keeping the output resolution native for the 4K TV. (3840x2160).
To deal with that, I do the command: 
```
xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --scale 0.6666666667x0.5
```
In that way, everything works as intended. The Sunshine shares the framebuffer resolution, matching my LG monitor while keeping the physical TV resolution unchanged. 

This behavior differs from the current scaling solution used by Hyprland because Hyprland's scaling factor keeps the framebuffer at the same resolution as the output and just resizes the content.

So, would be very nice if would there were some way to reproduce the mentioned X11 behavior on Hyprland in some form.",1
103,Submap Sudgestions,"### Description

## Current implementation

submap=open
bind=,Q,exec,qutebrowser
bind=,N,exec,neovide
...
bind=,escape,submap,reset 
submap=reset

```

## I would like to suggest some improvements :

### More user friendly way to set it in the config
in a way to prevent human errors and have people bricking 
their compositors.

```
bind=$mainMod,o,submap,open

submap {
    name = open
    reset = escape # without a valid escape the config errors
    persist = false # reset submap after a single key hit that matches
    fallthrough = true # if keys that dont belong in submap should fall through or be blocked

    bind=,Q,exec,qutebrowser
    bind=,N,exec,neovide
}
```
Something like this maybe ?

### Persist 

Have the submap reset after a single key hit that matches
This could be emulated probably in 2 ways 
I think the simplest way to add this would be `submap[flags]` just like binds if its not possible to change the config structure

```
...
    bind=,Q,exec,qutebrowser
    bind=,N,exec,neovide
...

    bind=,Q,submap,reset
    bind=,N,submap,reset
# For each bind above set a submap reset

```
Or

```
...
    bind=,Q,exec,qutebrowser && hyprctl dispatch submap reset
    bind=,N,exec,neovide && hyprctl dispatch submap reset
# For each bind above call hyprctl
```
### fallthrough 
If keys that dont belong in submap should fall through or be blocked.
In the above examples anything other than Q and N gets fed to the focused windows.
If `false` nothing gets send to the windows until the submap resets .

107,"Allow setting multiple ""normal"" keys in keymaps","### Description

In the current version, it's possible to create a bind with multiple modifier keys. It would be a nice quality-of-life feature to also be able to do so with ""normal"" keys. These kinds of binds can be less straining on the pinky and more accessible for minimal keyboard layouts.

Here are some comfy binds that would be possible:
- `SUPER + s + [hjkl]` to resize instead of `SUPER + SHIFT + [hjkl]`
- `SUPER + m + [1234]` to move to workspace instead of `SUPER + SHIFT + [1234]`

In config, it could look like this
```py
# Space syntax
bind = SUPER, s h, resizeactive, -20, 0
# Underscore syntax
bind = SUPER, s_h, resizeactive, -20, 0

### Bug or Regression?

Bug

### Description

Floating wIndow position is not retained when toggling between 'tile' and 'floating' state.

### How to reproduce

1. Open any window as 'floating'. Do not define any window rules for it (except `float` and `size`).

119,Dispatcher `movewindoworgroup` to move into/out-of an unlocked group,"### Description

I would like a dispatcher to move windows into/out-of groups when the window is not in a locked group.

This effectively combines `moveintogroup` and `moveoutofgroup`, but allows using the same bind for both dispatchers. This would work because groups can be locked, in which case this dispatcher would move the group rather than a window.

```
bindm = mouse:276, movewindoworgroup
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, left, movewindoworgroup, l
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, right, movewindoworgroup, r
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, up, movewindoworgroup, u
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, down, movewindoworgroup, d

Maybe name it one of these:
- `movewindowmaybegroup`
- `moveunlockedwindow` (Makes less sense when a window outside of a group)
- `movewindoworgroup` (I like this one best)

**First of all: Thanks for this awesome project, and congrats to all maintainers & contributors! :heart:**

I'm just coming from Sway/i3 and I would like to reproduce a behaviour I am really used to: the tabbed split container layout.

It seems that this is not working out-of-the-box in Hyprland. I read [the docs about tabbed windows](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dispatchers/#grouped-tabbed-windows) and I've added `bind = $mainMod,w,togglegroup` to my config.

However, what this does is just create a new group for the currently focused window. What I would like instead is to have a key binding for having all my current workspace's windows grouped together in the same tab group. And another key binding to switch back from that to a split view where windows are split normally.

What is the right way to achieve that in Hyprland?

Once I have a clear view of how to do that, I can add a section to the documentation (through a PR on the wiki repo) to explain how this can be achieved in Hyprland!

Thanks a lot again for all this work, and for any help you can provide.

123,Add gradient  stops,"### Description

**Feature**: The gradient currently has a fade/blur effect. Not the correct words but I can explain with the help of the picture below:

**Purpose**: I want to have gradient similar to the fifth stripe. This enables strictly one sided borders. I want to have borders only on the top and use borders on other sides as gaps by keeping them fully transparent. This results in a thick visible active window indicator while also saving me space on gaps.

124,Import environment variables into systemd in NixOS modules,"### Description

## Issue

Frankly speaking, using the nixos modules without modification is a XDG-""nightmare"".

This is because almost all XDG/GIO calls happen through portals. The problem being that the portals are being started as a user session service by systemd. This means that important environment variables like PATH and XDG_DATA_DIRS are not accessible. Then again there are many applications that ignore default mime applications completely and look at [Well-known Message Bus Instances](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-types) instead.

To bring order into this situation I personally did 2 things:
- Some packages install well-known bus type dbus services (usually located in `.../share/dbus-1/`) . To select a default I will symlink the corrects one the most dominant name (usually something like org.freedesktop.BasicFoo1).
- I add the following line  in my config after declaring variables and before starting any services:
```
exec-once = ${pkgs.dbus}/bin/dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd --all
```

## Proposal

I would like to:
1. Add this information to documentation. Even the first point is necessary because Hyperland does not ship with any default tools, so every n00b will throw together their own distro and cry about XDG issues.
2. Add the line in the config by default (at least when using nix module). Home-manager already provides a way to declare environment variables for a session, so it should be fine to add the line at the top of the config.

135,Enhancement for special workspace,"Hi, thank you for all the amazing works! 
I have some suggestions for special workspace. 

1. Add a config option to make a special workspace to have only 1 window (or a limited number of windows)

   This is useful when you have a file manager inside a special workspace. When you open a file in the file manager, you generally hope that the file will fallback into the normal workspace, but not tiled together with the file manager in the special workspace.

2. Make ""togglespecialworkspace"" avaliable to toggle on special workspace that have no windows yet. 

   This makes it convenient to first toggle the special workspace on then launch something inside it.

These can all be achieved with bash scripts, but I found them to be rather tricky or have strange bugs. So I suggest them to be built-in features.",1
136,Add the possibility to desaturate inactive windows,"Currently it's possible dim inactive windows. It would be nice if an option could be added for desaturating inactive windows. 
While dimming makes a window darker, desaturating keeps the brightness but removes the color intensity (so completely desaturated it would be greyscale). 


Alternatively the ability to run a custom shader on inactive windows would be great too (and with that the desaturating feature wouldn't be needed in hyprland itself anymore)",1

In particular, I'd like a `floatmovewindow`, which drags and drops a window while also making it a floating window, replicating the default behavior of several X11 window managers, such a Xmonad. Its dual `tilemovewindow`, which would drag and drop a window inside the layout even if it was originally floating, has its uses.",1

I've been playing around a lot with Hyprland and I find it amazing so far.

I am really used to i3wm, and I am not being able to achieve the same result with Hyprland.

In my i3wm config I have this bindings for ""moving"" windows.

bindsym $mod+Shift+h move left
bindsym $mod+Shift+j move down
bindsym $mod+Shift+k move up
bindsym $mod+Shift+l move right

Whenever the focused window is in tile mode it behaves like ""movefocus"" Hyprland dispatcher, and when the focused window is floating it behaves like ""moveactive"" Hyprland dispatcher.
I mean, basically, when focused window is in tile mode it switches with the next tile window in the direction you want, and when the focused window is in floating mode, you can move it around your current desktop.

Is there any way to achieve this in Hyprland with the same binding? If not, would it be possible to add a new dispatcher in order to achieve this behavior?

Actually I was using [Irssi](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Irssi) which is an [irc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client , there we usually share youtube links and whenever I click on any of the links in the terminal it opens the firefox windows on top of the terminal windows ( it means firefox swallows the terminal windows because I set `swallow_regex = ^(kitty)$` and `enable_swallow = true` ). I cannot set an exception for firefox so that kitty can open firefox on different window because the title of the firefox application keeps on changing (for ex if you go to youtube.com it will show youtube in the title. If you go to discord.com it will show discord in the title). I think using something like `initialTitle` and `class` will be a great option.",1

    }
    bindr=CONTROL,66,exec, YDOTOOL_SOCKET=/run/user/1000/.ydotool_socket ydotool key 1:1 1:0

However, it's then impossible to bind the Esc key proper to anything, because pressing Caps will send the linux input key 1 == keycode 9 for hyprland, 

For example, both Caps and Esc will start foot if adding:

    bindr=,code:9, exec, foot

However, Caps alone could be used to send Esc in vim, and Esc alone could be mapped to some workspace action inhibited when modifiers are set.

To support that usecase and to help debugging complex bind/bindr mappings, it would be nice to add NONE to the acceptable modifiers: it would inhibit a bind if any modifiers are already set, for example to start foot with the Esc key proper while letting Caps send Esc for vim

    bindr=NONE,code:9, exec, foot

I have two monitors: one HD (DPi unscaled) other 4K (2x scale). There are plenty bugs and inconveniences according to this setup like Qt5 transition bugs where whole windows flickers, blurs, sometimes renders them unusable or ugly, blurry xwayland apps.
But if I would set 4K resolution, set DPi 2x and downscale it to HD I could've have 2 conform screens, with the same DPi. I could've set xwayland apps to scale them 2x in DPi also that wouldn't grow enormous on that HD display. According to this there should be a way to disable wm xwayland scaling.

175,Better messages on plugin load fail,"Not gonna make a PR cause don't really know how you'd want to handle this, but currently the only thing you get if a plugin fails to load is a `error in loading plugin` which happens when `loadPlugin` returns a `nullptr`, there's 4 places where that can happen. I know you can see the whole thing in the log but would be more convenient to see the actual error when you run the command (I think).

176,[Feature]: adding timeout to bindr and windowclass to all binds,"I would be really nice to have a timeout option for bindr, after which the bind even would expire:

For example, if using the [example from the documentation](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Advanced-config/#binding-mods), rressing and immediately releasing Alt_L yields the desired behavior:

    bindr=ALT,Alt_L,exec,amongus

However, pressing then keeping Alt_L down for over 10 seconds will also yield the same result, while it's likely the intend changes more by every second that passes between the key press and the key release: for example: the user may have prepared to do a Alt Tab, but then change their mind after noticing a notification about an email.

A better behavior could be achieved with a timeout starting at the press event, then cancelling the bindr action if the timeout is reached without a bindr event, like for 2 seconds:

    bindr_bindl_timeout = ALT,Alt_L, 2

In this case, holding the Alt_L for longer than 2 seconds would inhibit the bindr action: among would not have been started past 2 seconds of holding the key down.

It would also be desirable to add window rules as both inclusions and exclusions, for example to never start amongus while reading email in thunderbird:

    bindr_inhibit= ALT,Alt_L, class:^(thunderbird)$

The same approach could be used require that a given application be focused, for example to only process bindr events for the SHIFT modifier when using xwayland applications:

    bindr_require= SHIFT,, xwayland:1

Alt_L would work as before, but using something xwayland would prevent the bindr for SHIFT modifiers.

This would allow application specific shortcuts, as it could also possible more generally to only process regular bind events for say the CONTROL modifier when using kitty:

    bind_require = CONTROL,, class:^(kitty)$,title:^(kitty)$

181,Global Fullscreen,"Hello!

I've been using hyprland for a week know, and everything has been working fine. I absolutely love this WM.

On the [wiki page about rules](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/#rules) it shows the `dimaround` windowrule. Also, at the end of that page, it talks about what layers are, and it seems that they only have the `noanim` rule. I have a custom rofi powermenu script for login out, reboot, etc. If I didn't understand uncorrectly, `rofi` would be a layer, and it seems to be since I can see it in `hyprctl layers` as `namespace: rofi`, and not in `hyprctl clients`.

It would be very much appreciated if we could also dim around a powermenu like that.

In that case, I think right now it wouldn't be possible to differentiate between more than one type, since `hyprctl layers` doesn't seem to report any difference between app launcher / powermenu script.

Unfortunately I've noticed some issues with this. The Rofi window looses focus if for example, Discord is launching behind it. I can elaborate if needed, but this is a digression.

The actual feature request I want to make is as follows.

When `no_cursor_warps = true`, moving a window to another workspace behaves as expected, and the cursor retains its position. That is fine, because the mouse cursor has `follow_mouse = 2` anyway. But I would like keyboard focus to move with the window, so that I can continue using the bind without needing to re-focus the window. This only happens when the window moves to another minitor's workspace AFAIK.

Xmonad and Sway have different layout rules for how it lays out the windows and how they

219,Separate windows from containers,"Firstly, I wanted to congratulate you. Hyprland feels great when opening new windows and I can only imagine how it's going to feel in weeks, months, years!

You say on your README that you need testers / feedback, so here it is. I really hope this is useful as these are my reasons for clinging onto sway despite wanting a fresh window manager. Even though I wrote a fair bit of feedback, I really hope you don't take it personally as I still think the program is great, if anything I wrote a lot *because* I want to switch and I want to flag things that are important to myself and potentially others too!

## FEEDBACK

My feedback might be taken the wrong way, but what I want from Hyprland is to be i3/sway, but nice-feeling and looking. Now I don't know if the development ethos is to branch off from i3/sway or to steal users from it, but my feedback can be summed up to 'it doesn't operate in the way I'd expect it to like in sway'.

The biggest thing for me is the idea of containers vs windows. In sway, I can specify that I want a container of windows stacked vertically or horizontally. By nesting these containers, I can make any formation I like quickly and efficiently. When making a tabbed layout, I can easily control which windows I want in the tabbed grouping, and which ones I do not. I can also traverse the hierarchy of containers and select an entire group so that I can move them around etc.

Another benefit i3/sway has is that when resizing a container, it's kind of like you're acting on the splits in-between windows:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8940077/168881176-08c2843b-025c-4411-8fb2-1fa1e797a755.png)

If I hold the right mouse button on the left white window, I'd resize only that border to the left or right. Resizing any of the other 
windows will affect both the left/right horizotnal split, and the up/down vertical split. This example works fine in isolation in Hyprland, but because of the way containers are laid out, it's hard to know whether I'm going to resize the right 'edge' of a window. Many times when I resize, I actually am affecting the opposite edge and growing the window in the wrong direction, ruining the structures of my other containers. If I then try to resize those containers, that can have a knock on effect depending on their trees as well.

While resizing is largely fixed by intelligently recognising how we want to resize and which edge we want to grow/shrink, containers play a big part in this in the sense that it's hard to know who is the parent of what. Here's an example in sway of 3 windows, where the latter 2 are in their own container:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8940077/168882553-92ae705a-a52b-4bd4-81bc-8fe231a756fa.png)

In Hyprland, this is how ALL windows feel. Rather than them all being in a common parent, it feels like they 'belong' to another window, but it's hard to know if A owns B or if B owns A, compounding the resizing issue. Since containers are at the core of i3 or sway, you know what owns what simply by how you instantiate your windows. You can also visualise where you're moving windows with the mouse in sway (I can't printscreen this sadly), which helps reorganise windows.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8940077/168883163-454380d5-94cc-4a1f-a37b-aa80cd5cabbe.png)

Here's how I WANT my windows to be - notice how the titlebar (that I enabled for debugging this) shows that the container has 3 windows inside it. This means that I can explicitly resize a child in the container, or the container itself. Here's why it matters when resizing:

In the first example, the last two windows are in their own group and occupy 50% of the space each. If I resize the split between the first and second window, I actually **resize all three windows**. The windows still share 50% of the space each, but since the space is growing they both widen in size.

In the second example, resizing the split between the first and second DOESN'T affect the third window, since I'm simply saying that the first window takes up less of the container, the middle window takes up more, and the last window is unchanged. This allows me to have my 3 column setup and have confidence in what I'm resizing in sway, and I find it really hard to manage my windows in Hyprland because of this.

## IN GOOD NEWS

I really love how you handle workspaces. I _still_ can't get a dynamic workspace system going in sway without relying on scripts. I really hate cluttering my scripts folder with things specific to my window manager to patch holes. I really like the ability to just make a new workspace on the fly and move things into it. While I can make new workspaces on the fly in sway, it's really difficult to actually move things into it since the workspace has to already exist in order to move things into it (unless I say 'move into workspace n'). You get top marks for this!

I also LOVE the animations and fadeins. It just feels like a more premium experience and I do value it!",1

the `hyprctl monitors` command should show any information that is configurable by hyprland using the monitor directive. notably, right now it doesn't report bit depth, so there's no easy way to programmatically validate if the monitor is running in 10bit mode after setting it in the config. it also doesn't show things like colour modes, for displays that use things like ypbpr, so it's hard to determine if you're running in something other than RGB.

 why did you decide against using json as message format for events ipc socket2?

I would imagine if it was json and the code just wrote to into socket on every change of data, it would make ipc plugins much more capable and flexible

Additionally to that sending a json of the same format as we get from hyprctl to socket and expecting the state of hyprland  to change accordingly, could be an easier way to script hyprland",1
224,Ability to swap all content of one workspace with another at once,"### Description

Sometimes  user may want to arrange workspaces with many windows in them, e.g. move the contents of one workspace to another, but doing this manually for each window with `movetoworkspace` dispatcher and arranging them afterwards is **TOO TIRESOME**.

### Proposition

Add `swapworkspacecontent` or `swapworkspacecontentsilent` dispatchers, which take `workspace` param and swap content of active workspace with content of specified workspace.  `swapworkspacecontent` will change active workspace to specified one,  `swapworkspacecontentsilent` - not.

This will allow basically rearrange workspaces on same monitor without pain it some places.

232,sway/i3-like window drag and drop,"### Description

Currently when you drag and drop a window, the position of your cursor does not matter.

In i3 and sway you get previews of the different drop zones and depending on what border you drop a window, it is placed to the top/bottom/left/right.

On Hyprland, with the dwindle layout, the window just gets placed where it fits best. This is unfortunate, as this ",1

Currently, using any `fullscreen` bind while already in fullscreen will put the user back into non-fullscreen mode.

235,Add a way to dismiss notifications,"### Description

Currently, there is `hyprctl notify` command, which can be used to create system notifications managed by hyprland. I'd love to be able to do something like `hyprctl notify-dismiss 2`, to dismiss the last 2 notifications, perhaps with a default to dismiss all notifications.

### My use-case

I'm using `hyprctl notify` to send a notification from `hypridle`, like so:

```
listener {
  timeout = 300
  # use hyprland notifications, in case dunst notifs are paused or whatever, also these have a nice progress bar
  on-timeout = hyprctl notify 0 10000 ""rgb(ff0000)"" ""System going idle in 10 seconds...""
}
```

Which works perfectly with the 10s timeout, as that's when another listener kicks in locking the session. However, it's pretty annoying that I can't dismiss this notification with `on-resume`.",1
236,Move workspace to monitor using direction,"### Description

Hello, there is a feature from Xorg that I'd love to see implemented in Hyprland.
The ability to move the current workspace to another monitor using the direction.

Currently the only options to move a workspace to another monitor is to specify which monitor. 
Instead, we could do something like `hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetomonitor 1 left` or `hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetodirection 1 left` to move the workspace to the left side monitor",1
237,Disable cursor follows focus,"### Description

Not sure if I am doing something weird here, my current setup is as follows. I have two monitors, I generally want a workspace per monitor (in reality I would want a workspace to span both but a workspace per monitor is fine) and to cycle between them per monitor, to do this I have in my config:
```
bind = SUPER SHIFT, right, movetoworkspace, r+1
bind = SUPER SHIFT, left, movetoworkspace, r-1

bind = SUPER CTRL, right, workspace, r+1
bind = SUPER CTRL, left, workspace, r-1

bind = SUPER, right, focusmonitor, +1
bind = SUPER, left, focusmonitor, -1
```

A small gripe I have is the with the `SUPER, ****, focusmonitor` combination the cursor moves with the focus.

Is there any way to have the cursor not follow focus when changing monitors?",1

240,Missing author credits for wallpapers and notification of new added wallpaper,"### Description

Many wallpapers are included in the Hyprland assets, but there seems to be no mention of credits or authors for these works. Acknowledging the artists work is crucial, especially to respect and appreciate the time and creativity invested in the creations.
This oversight not only disrespects the creative efforts of these individuals but also undermines the ethical standards expected within the open-source community. I'm particularly interested in knowing who created these wallpapers for potential future collaborations or commissions.

New wallpapers are added to the project without any announcement or notification to the users, this approach can lead to unexpected surprises for users in the professional context or environment, such as the appearance of random or potentially borderline content.

Here is the todo list:

- [ ] Add artist credits
- [ ] Content guidelines - guidelines for what constitutes acceptable content for wallpapers included and standards for appropriateness
- [ ] User notifications and consent - before introducing new wallpapers, it should be better implementing a notification system or an option to review and accept these changes could enhance the user experience",1

242,Bring back the mascot,"### Description

I saw on Reddit that the Hypr-chan wallpapers have been removed. The boomers still using Reddit in 2024 are now rejoicing in the fact that Hyprland has become more matured. I think it has become less cool, perhaps we might even call it Boomerland now. Speaking on behalf of Gen-Z and feminism, I protest that Hypr-chan be added back.

From Reddit:
> Nothing said ""accessible software for everyone"" than a drawing of an overtly sexualised girl... Good riddance.

The girl is not even overly sexualized. It's just a cool girl wearing nice outfits. Only the patriarchy would ever say something like that.

Nothing says ""accessible software for everyone"" than based non-corpo pilled software with a waifu mascot.

I see from the commit that there was a contest, and I don't know how it was conducted. If I were to know nothing better, I'd say the voting was hijacked by corporate AI to enforce the will of American right wing traditionalist capitalists. How did [this abomination](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/v0.35.0/assets/wall1.png) (which is the corpse of Hypr-chan, how disrespectful) win instead of [this](https://hyprland.org/imgs/blog/contestWinners/Meptl.png)?

To the complaining boomers: the future is now, old man.

- For boomers who hate anime girls: That's against feminism, level up to the 21st century
- For people who hate anime: Anime is better than reality so shut up
- If these don't work: On first launch, ask if you are chad enough to be in the presence of Hypr-chan, our mascot. If no, set `disable_hyprland_logo` to `true` before loading the wallpaper.",1

244,[dwindle layout] Swap window with (tree) neighbour dispatcher,"### Description

Hey,

In other bspwm-like window managers, there is usually a dedicated function for ""swapping"" a window with its *tree*-neighbour, which is a distinct operation from swapping it with an adjacent window. Illustration, with A in focus:

```
Appearance:

 | B |   |
 |---+ A |
 | C |   |

Tree:

     *
    / \
   *   A
  / \
 B   C
```

After 'swapwindow, l`:

```
Appearance:

 | B |   |
 |---+ C |
 | A |   |

Tree:

     *
    / \
   *   C

 B   A

But what I want is instead this:

 | A +---|
 |   | C |

Tree:

   *
  / \
 A   *

245,Merge or add hyprXPrimary plugin to allow set xwayland primary displays and resolutions within hyprland itself,"### Description

Please take a look at https://github.com/zakk4223/hyprXPrimary

This plugin allows to set X11 apps primary display on wayland, which should not be a plugin, it should be a main functionality within hyprland itself.
Please consider adding it in the future, it lacks the feature to set resolutions though, that should be a nice addition to it if it's possible.

Setting display properties should be in the main project I think, this is very neat and works at the most part as I tested.

246,Export highest resolution monitor to programms or define a primary display,"### Description

### [Problem]
When using two monitors with different resolutions and the lower resolution monitor is picked as primary, the lower resolution is exported to most apps and someone refuse to accept any resolution higher than the lower resolution monitor.
This means If Hyprland picks a monitor, the games might refuse to run at the resolution of the highest monitor, resuling in n low quality and streching if another monitor is used than the primary.

### [Fix]
The resolution that apps and games get is the highest resolution of all monitors instead of the primary.
As Alternative settinge the primary monitor via the config would bei a viable fix too.

### [Example]

how the config could look:

`
monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1,primary
`

this would set the display as primary for wayland and Xwayland application.

Hi, i think that window decorations should have a way to tell to the compositor that there is a change in positioning info to allow dynamic resizing of reserved area, sticky edges, etc.
I've looked up in the issues, opened and closed ones, and not found something similar.
I was playing with window methods, many functions, hacking the rendering pipeline, for the sake of triggering a call to IHyprWindowDecoration::getPositioningInfo() but it's only called on instance creation. The idea is to make responsive decorations.
I don't think in reloading plugins or reattaching decoration instances as a good solution. Maybe a call to HyprWindowDecoration::updateWindow() or other periodic method could return the new positioning info.",1
251,A variable to exclude layer shells from windows' blur source,"### Description

My goal is to have a contiguous blur between the terminal and waybar here:

![image](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/77421532/850b4b3a-d46d-4789-a284-fdcddd4baf87)

The issue is that, based on the render order of the window and bar, we either include the window (with `""layer"": ""top""` in waybar config) or the bar (with `""layer"": ""bottom""`) in the other side's blur source image. This causes the ugly shadow-like effect starting from the top of the bar.

I would like to be able to configure Hyprland such that the following happens:
1) The bar and its blur effect (using background as a source since it's at the bottom) gets rendered into a separate buffer.
2) Windows and their effects are rendered as if the bar isn't present.
3) The layers are composited together in background -> bar -> windows order.

This would allow me to have the contiguous blur as I described.",1
252,Workspace dispatch to switch between seperate monitor workspaces.,"### Description

In Dispatchers/Workspaces currently you can filter between active workspaces and active workspaces on the current monitor, but the issue is then if you have two workspaces active that are bound to one monitor and then you want to switch to you second monitor, you would have to run your keybinding 3 times to get to the next monitor.

266,"Ability to specify colors with #color, not just rgb(color) or rgba(color)","### Description
According to the Hyprland documentation color can be specified in 3 formats - `rgba(rrggbbaa)`, `rgb(rrggbb)` and legacy ARGB, but can not be specified with commonly used almost everywhere format using a leading number sign (#), like `#RRGGBB` for six-value syntax and `#RRGGBBAA` for eight-value syntax with transparency. When I try to specify it in this format, it just applies a transparent color.

### Why?
I have some global pallete in this format, that automatically applied to all configs and work everywhere, from cli tools to browser themes, but not in Hyprland. Also it's not even a proper rgb format like `rgb(255,255,255)`, it's just hex triplet inside rgb(), so it probably won't be valid anywhere outside Hyprland.

289,Vim like <leader> key functionality.,"### Description

In Vim key combinations with the <leader> key don't require the <leader> key to be held down the entire time, instead after the <leader> key is pressed you have a short (default 1s) timeout to type the rest of the shortcut. 

This has the following advantages:
1. Significantly better one hand support, some keybinds are nearly impossible with one hand current such as meta+0 on QWERTY. This is especially useful if you are somebody that often keeps one hand on a mouse rather then both hands on a keyboard.
2. Better ergonomics, some claim that key chords can increase rates of RSI: (http://xahlee.info/kbd/banish_key_chords.html)
3. Reduced conflict with existing keybinds, most existing applications do not implement this kind of keyboard shortcut which reduces the conflict rate with existing software

My recommendation is to implement this kind of keybind for modifier keys as they do not directly type a letter when tapped so this should not conflict with existing behavior.",1

294,Add the ability to configure Mouse wheel scrolling speed.,"### Description

Mouse scrolling speed isn't much of an issue if I am using firefox, because firefox has it's own set of flags to configure scrolling. But on chromium based web browsers or electron applications the scrolling is terribly slow (atleast for me). So it would be realy cool to see a feature where I could configure Mouse wheel scrolling speed. Preferably not globaly but by using it as a window rule for certain applications to not affect other windows.",1
295,Support for `initialTitle` and `initialClass` in windowrulev2,"### Description

Spotify has recently received an update that changes the `title` based on the song that is currently playing.
This causes my windowrulev2 regex to stop working whenever a song plays:

`windowrulev2 = opacity 0.90 override 0.90 override, title:^(Spotify( Premium)?)$`

If I pause the song, the opacity goes back to 0.90. If I play the song again, my opacity automatically goes back to 1.

---

To fix this, it would be great if `initialTitle` and `initialClass` could also be used to match windows.
For instance, these are the properties for a spotify window when a song is playing:

```
class: 
title: Artist - Song
initialClass: 
initialTitle: Spotify Premium
```
When a song isn't playing, title is `Spotify Premium`.
I tried this:
```
windowrulev2 = opacity 0.90 override 0.90 override, initialTitle:^(Spotify( Premium)?)$
```

Sadly, this doesn't seem to work, I get the red bar up top with message: `Config error at line 18 [...] Invalid rulev2 syntax: initialTitle:^(Spotify( Premium)?)$`. 

(Also, for some reason, if I try it with `initialtitle` (without capital T), it has the same behaviour as `title`, and doesn't show a config error? I assume you're matching something with `.*title:`, because `asdftitle` also works lol)

296,2d screen for vr support,"### Description

looking into using hyprland with vr/ar glasses(headmounted display with 3dof) (xreal for example)

what i would like to have(if it doesnt require redesign pr from me is possible) is a regular 2d desktop, with a viewport for the visible part of UI that moves according to 3dof sensors(head position)
and optionally two overlapping viewports providing 3d effect for two eyes (side by side 3d)

Do you think its possible without significant changes to the current code base?

P.S An alternative that i can think of(without implementing the whole wm myself) would be to have a lightweight wayland compositor that displays a nested wayland compositor and provides only support for the ""headmovement"", would that be easier/slicker?",1
297,Support shadows being drawn within borders.,"### Description

Shadows were changed from being drawn within borders to outside of them. This is understandably desirable as you generally don't want the shadow to interfere with the color you set borders to. The issue is that hyprland now doesn't support a 'clean' way to only have a border on the active window while also having shadows. Currently there are two options:

1. setting the alpha of `general:col.inactive_border` to 00. This is the solution that worked prior to the shadow update, but now produces a border sized lack of shadow around the window

![20231209_15h39m50s_grim](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/43202406/f05f270f-a2f6-4e32-b39a-5122d99aabef)


2. Creating the windowrule `windowrulev2 = bordersize 0, focus: 0`, dynamically removing the border from inactive windows. This isn't viable as it causes windows to resize whenever focus changes which is generally quite jarring

https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/43202406/f76beba1-4855-4295-9584-18bd10718229

It would be great if there were an option to change whether or not shadows are drawn within borders our outside of them. Of course this would re-introduce the shadows interfering with  non-opaque border colors but for me that would be much more desirable than the current 2 options we have.",1
298,Hyprctl Reload to not wake up EDP-1 or laptop monitor,"### Description

First, Im not sure if this already been asked but I couldnt find it..

Anyway, I have this on my config
bindl = , switch:off:Lid Switch,exec,hyprctl keyword monitor ""eDP-1, preferred, auto, 1""
bindl = , switch:on:Lid Switch,exec,hyprctl keyword monitor ""eDP-1, disable""

When I close my laptop lid, All workspaces and the external monitor became now the ""main"" display and all workspaces including mouse cursor moved to external monitor. (which is good)


However, when I change something on the settings, i.e. change some color settings, or monitor settings, the hyprctl reload wakes up the eDP-1. Closing and opening lid will of course disable the laptop's main display.


One solution is to of course disable the hyprctl reload, however, the waybar that I set to reload during wallpaper automatic change does not work anymore. 


so probably you can set that if the Lid Switch is on, laptop monitor wont be wake up during reload.... something like that",1
299,Allow hyprctl instances even when HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE is unset,"### Description

`hyprctl instances` doesn't need `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` at all, and will work perfectly fine if it's set to some random gibberish. However, if it's entirely unset, it doesn't work because hyprctl errors very early on if the instance signature is unset, even if it doesn't actually end up using it. I think it would be nice if `hyprctl instances` could be used without an instance signature.",1

Alternatively, a new dispatcher `togglefloatandpop` (or `togglefloatactive`?)
much like `movewindoworgroup`: behaves like `togglefloating` if active window is not a group.

When unfloated, window should probably return to top of group (if still exists)

We should remove the home-manager module from this repo. The hyprland module that exists in home-manager is strictly better than the one here, and having two different modules leads to some confusion (~~see https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/4716~~ that wasn't the user's problem but I think the point still stands).

312,Support virtual keyboards: Steam,"### Description

Steam exposes the Steam Deck's keyboard at menu+x on a gamepad when it's running in the background (e.g. via `steam -silent`).

It is not currently usable in Hyprland because it dispatches its events for X11.  [extest](https://github.com/Supreeeme/extest/) can be used as a workaround (but it's not yet packaged for NixOS, so I haven't been able to test it).

Unlike [maliit](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3943), it does draw an interactive keyboard on the screen.  However, it draws on a layer above Hyprland.  It would be nice if Hyprland could reflow its layout to acommodate the keyboard.

I don't know how much of these virtual keyboard feature requests are to be handled in code vs. configuration, but since so little is written about them on the internet, it behooves Hyprland touch users to have them tracked here.",1

320,Make `float` rule dynamic (related issue with Bitwarden opening maximized window on vault unlock),"### Description

Unlocking a Bitwarden vault (from the Bitwarden extension) on Firefox causes a new maximized window to open. Bitwarden intends for only a small floating window to open, but I'm assuming there is some interference with the WM. So, windowrules.

The next issue is that Bitwarden initially opens the window as a regular Firefox instance (no unique `title` or `class` properties). Thus, it isn't possible(?) to prevent Bitwarden from initially opening the window maximized, unless there is a windowrule on all Firefox instances. However, Bitwarden does eventually rename  the window to `Extension: (Bitwarden - Free Password Manager) - Bitwarden — Mozilla Firefox`.

A solution is to apply windowrules properties, such as `float`, to the window when the `title` property changes. The only issue is that Hyprland doesn't mark the `float` rule as `dynamic`. Is there a reason behind this? Can it be feasibly implemented?

325,"Unable to start Hyprland, keeps landing loop","### Description

Hello, I am very eager for your help because I have a problem that is difficult to solve.

At the beginning, I updated the system and found that `xwaylandvideobridge-cursor-mode-2-git` was out of date, then I uninstalled it and installed `xwaylandvideobridge-git`, but now I can't get in, the desktop can only stay on the login page, the following picture is Hyprland's boot log

327,A way to disable window switching in fullscreen,"### Description

I'm often working with 2+ displays and move between them using `movefocus l/r/u/d`. This doesn't work as expected if one of the screens has multiple windows with one of them being in full screen mode.

Let's say I have two monitors side by side. On the left monitor I have a terminal and an IDE open, with the latter being full-screen; On the right screen I have a browser and a PDF document in regular dwindle layout, one under another. I move from the PDF to the left screen using `movefocus l` and then, after editing something, attempt to switch back to the right screen using `movefocus r`.

Expected behaviour:
1. I move to the right screen and focus a PDF document

Actual behaviour:
1. Instead of switching to the right monitor, I switch to the other app on the left monitor, meaning that terminal is now in fullscreen.
2. AFAIK, there is now no way to switch focus to the right monitor except for the use of `movetoworkspace`, which is much less convenient.

Proposed solution:
Adding a configuration parameter that would treat full screen window as the only one on the workspace, so it's not possible to focus the others using `movefocus` unless you exit full-screen mode.",1

This project now have a Code of Conduct, which say ""Our standards are: Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone ... Examples of breaking each rule respectively include: Harassment, bullying or inappropriate jokes about another person"", so this option name now doesn't fit in the project's standard. I think it's time to become more mature and change this joke name to something more neutral.

329,Plugin System,"### Description

The plugin system is nice and so much powerful.
But to get a plugin working it needs to be compiled and Hyprland needs to be compiled with it also.
Now that's what make it a bit cumbersome.

332,Numbered workspaces < 1,"### Description

Is there any particular reason why numbered workspaces have to start at 1? On i3 I got accustomed to using 0 for a terminal session. super+` would take me there. If I simply name a workspace to the string ""0"" then waybar wants to sort it at the end of the list of workspaces, which irks me. lol",1
333,Distinguish between single window and maximize mode window,"### Description

When using fullscreen 1, maximize mode, it is difficult to distinguish whether the current window is in fullscreen or normal single window state, so I want to make a border color plugin to distinguish

However, there are too many places for border to be re-rendered, so I can't fix the color of border in maximize mode state, just like in this video below, when I switch workspace, the color changes back

https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/30348075/a53d1c03-438c-4e2f-acf6-7428d8bd0591

I wonder if the border in this code can be directly skipped and not executed when it is in the maximize mode state

337,Toggleopaque for several window,"### Description

Hey, I searched for a while but didn't find anything to make this command on several (or all in my case) window at the same times. The only thing I found was to set a window rule with `hyprctl keyword windowrulev2 'opaque,class:(.)'` but only the new windows respect this rule and the active one. The other doesn't seems to detect the change.
Another technique I found was to source a file with this only rules, but the result is the same.

I'm trying to make a shortcut that disable animations, blur and set opacity to 1 but I can't without setting the opacity.

338,"Add monitor id to ""hyprctl workspaces"" output","### Description

""hyprctl -j clients"" provides 
```
 ""workspace"": {
        ""id"": 1,
        ""name"": ""1""
    },
```
but ""hyprctl -j workspaces"" only provides
```
""monitor"": ""DP-7"",
```
it is natural, and useful in arrays, to reference these objects by id, but to get to the monitor id it needs to be cross referenced.

Conversely, whilst a monitor name is, I believe, guaranteed to be unique, a workspace name is not, so it is not safe to loop up workspaces by their name. 

Ultimately it would be good to be able to have consistency between the two mappings of client to workspace and workspace to monitor.

I can see, however, that there is no obvious place to add it without disrupting the existing data format.",1
339,Provide debug symbols on debuginfod,"### Description

Would it be possible to upload Hyprland debug symbols? It would be really helpful!

Alternatively is there any way to debug a packaged Hyprland? Or is it necessary to compile it from source and start from scratch (it would be really hard to replicate the  exact configuration that is shipped with packages).

341,`swapworkspaces` Dispatcher,"### Description

I would like it if I would be able to swap two workspaces, i.e. swapping workspace 1 and 2 would make it so that all windows initially on workspace 1 end up on workspace 2 and all windows initially on workspace 2 end up on workspace 1.

As far as I cal tell, there isn't currently a way to do this with the available dispatchers.

343,Support for musl based systems,"### Description

For musl systems execinfo.h and its functions are not able to be used and it fails to compile. You may suggest installing libexecinfo to mitigate this problem however for musl systems libexecinfo has been dropped from alpine as well as gentoo for a long time now because it really wasn't a solution. I have created a patch that will allow every other system apart from musl to retain the execinfo stuff but on musl systems it removes that feature so it can compile. I am not a C developer so there are maybe a few mistakes in this patch file but I would love to hear your thoughts about this and hopefully we can work on incorporating this.

344,Request: match rotation between outputs and mapped inputs,"### Description

After the acceptance of #996 and #3220, Hyprland is _almost_ a first class experience on 2-in-1s! At this point, there is only one thing keeping me from switching entirely to Hyprland on my 2-in-1 laptop.

In Sway, it is possible to map inputs to outputs with the `map_to_output` message. This causes inputs to automatically rotate when their mapped output does, ensuring touch inputs always map correctly to dynamically rotated outputs (e.g. when using [rot8](https://github.com/efernau/rot8)). Hyprland also supports mapping inputs to outputs via the `inputs.touchdevice.output` keyword (and apparently maps inputs automatically when it can), but in my experience this does not lock the transform of the input to the output.

It's important for hyprland to support this in my opinion, because AFAICT there is no way for third-party programs to control the transform of existing input devices via a wayland protocol, so at the moment users will always have to implement their own, hyprland specific scripts to achieve what should be a universally desirable behavior: touchscreens inputting where the user's finger is, regardless of dynamic rotation.

Since there is already a `transform` option for inputs, perhaps the right way to implement this would be to _add_ any output rotation changes to the user-configured input rotation.",1
345,Change gaps and other decorative properties of special workspaces,"### Description

346,Allow dragging windows to a different workspace,"### Description

If I'm dragging a window with the mouse and switch to another workspace with a keybind, the dragging is immediately cancelled, but I think it would be cool to keep the window dragged so that you can drop it in the other workspace.",1
347,Support for software rendering backend,"### Description

Although most of today's graphics cards support hardware-accelerated rendering, some of the newer hardware may have difficulty working in hardware-rendering mode. For example, my intel iris Xe graphics card reports an EGL initialization error in hardware rendering, and it may not be able to use hardware-accelerated rendering under the i915 driver. Does hyprland have plans to support a software rendering backend? Sway and other wlroots support unity rendering backend, does hyprland have plans to support it?",1
348,Move Cursor to Active Window When Changing Workspaces,"### Description

When changing focus through the `movefocus` dispatcher, the cursor moves to the center of the active window. I would like this to happen when changing workspaces as well, and in general whenever focus shifts from one window to another. Is this currently possible to set?

349,Open app in background when windows is in maximize state,"### Hyprland Version

v0.30.0-49-gd61e4f9a

### Bug or Regression?

Bug

### Description

Previously: New windows would automatically switch to tiling mode.
Currently: All new windows are opening in a maximized state in the background.


### How to reproduce

1. Launch Hyprland (v0.30.0-49-gd61e4f9a)
2. Maximize an existing window.
3. Open a new window (e.g., using a specific keyboard shortcut or application launcher).
4. Observe the new window's behavior.

Expected Behavior:
I expect the new window to automatically switch to tiling mode, allowing me to see all windows simultaneously.

Actual Behavior:
The new window opens in a maximized state in the background, and I have to manually adjust it to tiling mode.

350,Screen lock and Idle Management Inside hyprland.conf,"### Description

Hello, first of all i would like to thank everyone who contributed to this beautiful project. The suggestion that I think can be added is that hyprland provides its own (by implemeting wayland protocols) screen locking and customizable lock screen system. We can do these functionalities thanks to softwares such as swaylock and swayidle, but it would be nice if we could make these settings directly in hyprland.conf and add more customization options. For example, in the variables section there can be a subcategory named locking just like blur, and we can make the necessary settings there.",1
351,create binds with non-mod-keys only.,"### Description

I have a very stupid mini-keyboard, not allowing me to rebind keys in any way, so i have to rely 100% on external software to do that. So i currently had my right menu key + f9-f11 bound to my media keys (because fn does not have that functionality).

Is there any way to bind for example menu + f10? because from what ive seen, only specific keys (like super, alt, etc) can be used for that. What i intend is using something like `bind = , menu ssharp, exec, playerctl play-pause`.",1

I have a setup with an external dock that is connected to two monitors. When I connect them, they sometimes get added as DP-5 and DP-6 and sometimes as DP-7 and DP-8.

354,Remove young girl image from default (non)background,"### Description

It's 2023, the image is not appropriate.

Having such an image randomly appear with each random video driver glitch and such is wrong. I'm fully aware that this can be disabled, but this is not a significant justification. Having to explicitly opt out of seeing it is not a justifiable reason to leave it within the Hyprland codebase.

It is clearly sexually loaded. If not, there would be an alternative with a visually male alternative, or potentially a person with no identifiable gender. Neither of these are the case, only a single, unrealistic image of a young girl. 

Outside of social sensitivities It is also just irrelevant. It is a very professional, high quality graphic, but it is not the Hyprland logo, it's not meaningful and has nothing whatsoever to do with a window manager. It should not be there. If someone likes it, great, they are free to go set it as their own personal wallpaper. This is not Hyprland's place.",1

357,Chroma key,"### Description

# What it is
I'm sure you know about green screens for TV, movies etc. They change all the pixels of a certain color to something else.
I would like to see an option that applies this to the compositor. For example 
```
chroma_key = #00ff00
chroma_replace = rbga(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3)
```
That would replace all a windows pixels that match chroma_key with chroma_replace or something similar
Or better yet a window rule
```
windowrulev2 = chroma_key #00ff00 rbga(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3), class:(firefox)
```

# Why the f ???
Many applications don't support transparency at all, or only in a half baked way. This would create an easy way for any program that has a customizable appearance to have transparency enabled, or even allow things like transparent web pages in browsers through the use of something like [stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

359,Hypr ちゃん wants to see you more often. Hypr ちゃん wants to meet you alone.,"### Description

I saw #3343 attempting to address concerns from #2930. However, I suggest two more improvements.

1. Remove `force_hypr_chan` and make her stay with you forever, or make her appearing consistently the default option (requires changing the `force_hypr_chan` name)
2. `disable_hyprland_logo` should disable the logo and not also Hypr ちゃん (since that makes way more sense now)",1
360,Provide an option to identify workspaces per-monitor as in Awesome WM,"### Description

The idea is to separate the workspaces, just as hyprsome does. Unfortunately, doing it from outside of hyprland is difficult due to many various reasons, and having it inside of hyprsome would:

1. Be easier to implement.
2. Would be easier to configure and use.
3. It would probably provide with much more options.

For anyone who has never worked with Awesome WM: if there is more than one monitor, for example, two, the workspaces are bound to the monitors in use: the first (`1`) workspace on one of the monitors is not the same as the workspace `1` on the other.
The current behaviour of Hyprland is that the workspace with id=1 is always unique and, once occupied, can't be reused on another monitor. The suggestion here is to make it optional to allow IDs to be unique inside the context of a monitor. This way is also backwards-compatible with one monitor.",1
361,hide bar and show it after pressed modifier,"### Description

The functionality I miss is the ability to hide the bar and show it only when pressing the appropriate button. `Sway` has this feature natively, without the need to kill the bar. I often have a few windows open and quickly check the CPU, RAM usage or even the time.

In `sway` I have this:
```
bar {
    swaybar_command waybar
    mode hide
    modifier Mod4
}
```

and in `waybar` I have this:

362,Customize border rounding on tooltips separately from windows,"### Description

At the moment, decoration:rounding affects both tooltip's and window's borders. However, there are cases where tooltips are intended to be rectangle-shaped, with borders being drawn inside of tooltip area.
I think there should be a way to set border rounding on tooltips separately. Even though tooltips aren't windows, I think a windowrule-like approach would suit them.",1
363,Give bars the possibility to movetoworkspace by dragging a window on a workspace,"### Description

Idk how this would be done or if it's even possible in the first place, but I think it would really be a nice feature to be able to just drag a window on top of a workspace number/icon/whatever on my bar and just drop it there.
Maybe it's possible to trigger an event or something if a window is dropped with the exact display location so bars can subscribe to the event to make something like this possible? 

 I use my pc all the time and while a very keyboard heavy workflow is great for work, it sometimes can be a bit annoying if you actually need 2 hands to move things. I guess I still need 2 hands to even drag a window (I wish there was like a button I could press to enable somehow a mouse only drag and drop kinda workflow for the less productivity heavy stuff I'm doing; something like a mouse 4 + mouse 1 to drag a window or to be able to show header bars which can be dragged)
",1
364,Your implementation preferences?,"### Description

I'd like to add some floating-window specific features & changes and would like your advanced input on basic design goals.

An example is the dispatcher `bringactivetotop`.  I'd like to implement `pushactivetobottom` and would like to know if that's a good name choice/implementation style, or if you'd rather a single new dispatcher w/ a parameter for top/bottom, or something completely different?

There's a collection of other small improvements as well, would you want this all as separate PRs or one?

Thanks!",1
365,Add a Contributor Code of Conduct,"### Description

Contributor codes of conduct are very important to all open source projects as to avoid discriminatory practices. I feel that Hyprland could really use a Code of Conduct that may also apply to other Hyprland-related communities. See: [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).",1

For example: windowrulev2 = workspace name:4.Games-Misc, fullscreen: 1 floating: 1",1
367,Remember focus per-workspace,"### Description

Current behaviour seems to be that, when switching workspaces, the focused window on the workspace you're switching to matches (as best it can) the focus of the workspace you're switching from.

i.e. if I'm on workspace 1 with three windows open and focus on the first window, then switch to workspace 2, also with three windows open and switch focus to the third window, then switch back to workspace 1 and focus is on the third window.

It'd be nice if workspaces 'remembered' which window is focused. *Or* just focus the first window when switching (I did the latter with keybinds but that breaks monocled workspaces out of monocle mode when switching to them).

Apologies if this is mentioned elsewhere - I did search - or possible in configs - I did try!",1
368,Remove speed and curve requirement when disabling animations.,"### Description

With current behavior, you have to define `SPEED` and `CURVE`, even when you are disabling an animation.

The plugin system is very cleaver and OP.

The only ""drawback"" is from what I can tell - you'll have to pin your plugins to

374,Add custom resolution support through modeline,"### Description

Sometimes, setting up a custom resolution not natively supported for your monitor is desirable. Example: when you're using adapters for connecting CRT monitors or projectors using an HDMI-to-VGA or HDMI-to-YPbPr adapters. In other cases it's when you're mirroring the screen using a GPU-hardware-accelerated feature does in Sunshine, setting up a custom resolution is needed.
I want to ask for supporting ""modeline"" settings, like the existing ones in Sway and X11.
Use case example. Let's suppose that I want to enable the resolution 2560x1080 on a monitor that the connected display does not natively support or not informing at the ""edid"" the intended resolution.

1. Using the cvt command line utility, for obtaining the intended modeline.
```
$ cvt 2560 1080 60
# 2560x1080 59.98 Hz (CVT) hsync: 67.17 kHz; pclk: 230.00 MHz
Modeline ""2560x1080_60.00""  230.00  2560 2720 2992 3424  1080 1083 1093 1120 -hsync +vsync
```
2. Setting up Hyprland settings file to setup and use the intended modeling:

hyprland.conf
```
modeline=HDMI-A-1,2560x1080_60.00, 230.00,  2560, 2720, 2992, 3424,  1080, 1083, 1093, 1120, -hsync, +vsync
monitor=HDMI-A-1,2560x1080@60,0x0,1
```
being the ""modeline"" options as described:
```
modeline=<output>,<name>,<clock>, <hdisplay>, <hsync_start>, <hsync_end>, <htotal>, <vdisplay>, <vsync_start>, <vsync_end>, <vtotal>, <hsync>, <vsync>
```",1
375,Dispatcher to manipulate dwindle layout splits,"### Description

This feature is supposed to be a new dispatcher(for example, splitwindow, with a direction argument)

This explanation expects that the dwindle layout windows are in a tree-like hierarchy

1. Suppose we have:
    Our focused window `F`(node `nF`)
    It's parent node `nP`
    A function to get the window in a direction(maybe the same implementation as swapwindow dispatcher has) `get_dir(direction)`

2. Explanation
    When the dispatcher is called, for example `hyprctl dispatch splitwindow direction_var`
    you move the `nF` node from being a child of `nP` to being a child of `get_dir(direction_var)`,
    creating a new split from the `get_dir(direction_var)` node and removing a split from the `nP` node.

    If the `get_dir(direction_var)` function doesn't return a window, simply do nothing lol

This feature request exists because this functionality already exists with a mouse:
`bindm = $mainMod, mouse:272, movewindow`

Maybe here's a more detailed explanation of what should occur when you call `hyprctl dispatch splitwindow r`
https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1668v99/keybind_to_manipulate_window_layout/

I made a vid demonstrating how this feature would work:

hmm in dwm the windows stay in monocle mode because all opened and new windows would be maximized then and if i press keybinding to tile mode all windows would be tiled but if i have a rule in dwm to open window float then only that window is floating but the rest stay maximized or tiled because of the monocle or tiled mode and that is what i want -> i don't want that windows change to tiled if i open a new windows or close a window or open a window in other monitor

379,X wayland screen share low FPS when not on monitor,"### Description

When I screen share a Xwayland window (in my case xwaylandvideobridge) on discord it runs fine if the streamed window is present on one of my monitors. However, if I switch workspaces and the streamed window isn't on either of my monitors anymore the stream display in around 1 FPS.

Of course this does not happen on a normal screen share via pipewire. Also, not rendering all frames of a window, that is not visible, is probably intended behavior.

Right now I am working around the issue with a small script that listens on an IPC socket and moves my xwaylandvideobridge to my active workspace at the monitor I'm on.

However I would like to request a variable or a mode that allows for xwayland windows or windows in general to stay on the active workspace or be rendered actively.",1

399,Add Option to move Workspace to current Monitor,"### Description

It would be nice to have the option of moving a workspace to the monitor where the cursor currently is. This would be useful for moving around Workspaces in multi-monitor setups.

### Bug or Regression?

Bug

### Description

Hi! Trying Hyprland out as a sway/i3 user, so please bear with me if this isn't supported or is working as intended.

I'm trying to replicate the behavior where `Shift` + `Mod` + `<direction>` moves a window and changes the layout as if it was re-nested under that branch.

I use `bind = SHIFT_$mainMod, H, movewindow, l` to bind `Shift` + `Super` + `H` to move a window to the left, but when I do, it doesn't work as expected.

For example, given the following window layout:
```
Monitor 1
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│ ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │ App 1         │ │ App 2         │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │

│ │               │ ┌───────────────┐ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │ App 3         │ │
│ │               │ │ Active Window │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

I expect the following window state:

```
Monitor 1
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│ ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │ App 1         │ │ App 2         │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ └───────────────┘ │               │ │
│                   │               │ │
│ ┌───────────────┐ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │ App 3         │ │               │ │
│ │ Active Window │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

However, instead, I see this behavior:
```
Monitor 1
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│ ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │ App 3         │ │ App 2         │ │
│ │ Active Window │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ └───────────────┘ │
│ │               │                   │
│ │               │ ┌───────────────┐ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │ App 1         │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ │               │ │               │ │
│ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ │
│                                     │

This result seems to be identical in behavior to `swapwindow`.

408,Double fractional scaling for dpi-aware apps,"The foot terminal emulator recently implemented fractional scaling.  With two monitors of different physical dimensions and hyprland set to scale them each at 1.0, foot now changes its font size to look identical on each screen - but other apps are too small as they can't do this trick.

If hyprland is set to scale the physically smaller monitor higher than 1.0, it appears that both foot and hyprland apply scaling and it ends up too big.

I am not sure if it's possible for hyprland or foot, or any other wayland app, to be aware of eachothers' dpi awareness capabilities, but it would be cool to be able to run in a mixed mode where the compositor is scaling apps that are not dpi-aware while apps that can do it on their own are allowed to do so.",1

Essentially, the query equivalent to the `r` variable for workspace identifiers.",1

411,Allow floating windows under tiled windows,"So, I'm trying to replicate aspects of my config from KDE on Hyprland, and everything is coming along nicely. Except that I used to have Cava inside a terminal, positioned to cover the bottom half of my screen, and have it be under all windows.

I managed to get everything I wanted using window rules (and some aspects of it even better than with KDE's window rules):
```conf
windowrulev2 = float,          class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = pin,            class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = noanim,         class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = noblur,         class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = noborder,       class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = nodim,          class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = nofocus,        class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = noinitialfocus, class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = noshadow,       class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = rounding 0,     class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = size 100% 50%,  class:(kitty),title:(cava)
windowrulev2 = move 0% 50.2%,  class:(kitty),title:(cava)
``` 

...but I can't get the window under all of the other windows. Basically, the entire point of my visualizer.

Did I miss something, or are floating windows never allowed under tiled windows?

If so, I was thinking I could maybe specify a layer for the window to be in (I mean the things you could see by running `hyprctl layers`)?

EDIT: searching around more through the issue tracker, I noticed #2081 talks about basically the same feature",1
412,Allow switching to a window in a dwindle group via xdg-activation and `misc:focus_on_activate = true`,"Steps to reproduce: 

0. Set `misc:focus_on_activate = true`
1. Make a dwindle group with two windows, one of them being firefox or pavucontrol
2. Ensure that the active window is not firefox or pavucontrol.
3. Switch to another workspace.
4. Open an URL in another app, or launch pavucontrol again.
5. Observe that the switch fails and an urgency hint is set instead.

Moreover, when step 3 is skipped, nothing in the dwindle group seems to be focused.
This was mentioned in #2329 but was not fixed along with that.",1

414,Layer rules rounding,"I was starting to use the layer rules on my EWW (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets) configuration and it is working pretty well until I noticed a minor issue. The blur layer is just not rounded at all but my hyprland config sets a rounding of 10. Even the css of my widgets applies border-radius and it indeed round the widget but it seems hyprland does not see it.

So I don't know if it is intended or not but I would like to apply rounding to a layer rule.

419,zext_workspace_handle_v1.activate() for empty workspaces,"I'm one of the contributors of waybar, and the one who implemented persistent workspaces.

With #2084 being implemented, you no longer need the patch to switch to workspaces with windows in them. This isn't true for empty persistent workspaces though, since they still require hyprctl to switch to.

Pardon my lack of wlroots knowledge, but is it possible to implement `zext_workspace_handle_v1.activate()` for empty workspaces? It is my undersanding that the workspace wouldn't exist and would need to be created when activate is called.",1
420,Add background color options for groupbar and gradients,"I use swww dynamic wallpaper, so the groupbar is relatively hard to see. i don't see any option to change background color. Can add them?",1
421,Fullscreening all windows inside a split,"This is bit hard to describe, so I'm attaching a visual here. I'm a former herbstluftwm user and one bit of functionality that I miss from it is the ability to have a document I'm working with maximized to one side of the screen, while being able to toggle between multiple documents that are maximized to the opposite side. Again, hard to explain, so here's a visual mock-up I made of what it would look like in Hyprland:

![SplitScreenMockup](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/3809531/88e9f285-33ea-4793-ad90-8ed0a13c9137)

As you can see, the notes document remains maximized on the left side of the split and the user is able to work in it while flipping between the multiple windows on the right. Herbstluftwm accomplishes this through a combination of a static split and fake-fullscreen behavior that fullscreens all the documents on the right to the dimensions of the right-hand split.

To be clear, I have read elsewhere here that Hyprland has no plans to implement static splits and that's fine. I'm merely wondering if there's a way to achieve the same effect with the current dynamic-split functionality. Perhaps it's already implemented and I've not fully understood the documentation — if so I would love someone to point the way to what I've missed. Otherwise, I would love it if some version of this functionality could be implemented.

Many thanks, either way.",1
422,Show groupbar when no_gaps_when_only is true,"When `no_gaps_when_only` is set to true and only a single window is on a workspace, the groupbar is also hidden. However, this makes it visually impossible to tell if a window is a group. The groupbar should be shown regardless of `no_gaps_when_only`.",1
423,Overview feature previewing all opened clients ,"swipe up to preview all clients opened and easily switch between them using trackpad.
Now typing this makes me feel like this is a dumb feature request for a tiling wm *compositor

424,Re-enable monitor after disabling it with hyprctl,"Before I write a script for this, I thought it would be a good idea to pitch it as a feature - or maybe it already is, but I can't figure it out.
I'd like to be able to re-enable a monitor after I've disabled it using `hyprctl keyword monitor <input>,disable`. The only way do this right now I believe, is to parse the `hyprland.conf`, search for the monitors configuration, and set it using `hyprctl keyword monitor` again - or, if it is not defined in the config, use defaults.

Is this something that could be done? Perhaps by adding `hyprctl keyword mointor <input>,enable`? I guess adding it as a feature would be better than a script, as changes not stored in `hyprland.conf` could be restored when being enabled.",1
425,cachix unreliable,"@fufexan 

I have noticed that I'm building hyprland very often. 

It would be nice if there was a more reliable way of getting the cached version over `hyprland` (perhaps by using the `nixpkgs` pinned by `hyprland` in the overlay or at least exposing an overlay that acts like that?)",1
426,interact with tabbed containers using the mouse,"Would it be possible to add the ability to click on tabs in tabbed layout containers and to use the scroll wheel to switch between tabs when the mouse is over them?  Similar to how you can interact with tabbed/stacked layouts in i3.

Sorry if this is already a thing, I couldn't find it anywhere in open issues or the wiki.  I think if I bound `changegroupactive b` and `changegroupactive f` to the mouse wheel it would work but then it works everywhere, not just above the tabs.

Thanks for all your hard work on this project!  I'm really enjoying using it.",1
427,next workspace on an output,"I'd like to identify all workspaces on an output and cycle between them.  Basically reproducing i3's `workspace next_on_output` and `workspace prev_on_output` commands.

I think a good starting place for this might be to include an additional key in the `monitors` query for hyprctl for Workspaces.  Currently it reports the active workspace, but I have not found a way to identify all the other ones on the same output to script this.  Is there already a way to do this by chance?

Apologies for asking what is basically a question, but I suppose if it's not possible I'd like to suggest it as a feature.  I'm just not sure and could use some help.

429,Multiple Special workspaces,"Hi there - is it possible to have multiple special workspaces?

430,Feature: ability to apply screen shader per monitor,"I have two monitors; one has washed-out colors and the other doesn't. I can fix the washed-out monitor by modifying the gamma using a custom screen shader. However, the shader applies to all monitors so this makes the normal monitor look bad.

Would it be possible to make the monitor number (or global pixel position) accessible in the fragment shader so that color modifications can be applied conditionally?",1
431,Persistent Desktop that keeps the apps open that you shut down using,"I read through the documentation and guidelines for bash scripts but couldn't find anything that would be suitable to do what I want to do.

I was previously using a tiling window environment called Material Shell that was build on top of Gnome. We could have a persistent desktop with this so that when we restart, it saves the state of the programs that are open upon shutdown.

Is there a way we can do this with Hyprland?

I've done a workaround with starting my regular applications on different desktops but it's not really the same. I might be working on a specific project and when I restart, it will open VScode without that project in its current state.


",1
432,Feature: togglable scratchpads,"Thank you for introducing special workspaces.

Are the any plans to introduces scratchpad/special workspace that can be toggled with the same keybinding to show/launch and hide an app? Similar to how qtile and xmonad handle scrachpads?

Right now [pyprland](https://github.com/hyprland-community/pyprland) tries to achieve this but is not ideal and it would be great to have this supported natively.",1
433,Add support for matching monitors by serial number,"The reason for this is that for people such as me who ""share"" monitors between different machines (whether it be with an HDMI switch or plug/unplug), the DP of the monitors that are being switched changes after every plug/unplug, which makes it impossible to configure their position and any other related option that requires a DP number.

A more concrete example :
My middle monitor, DP-3, is being toggled to display either my  linux or windows machine. Everytime it gets toggled to windows and then back to linux, its DP changes. DP-3 -> DP-5 -> DP->7 etc.. ",1
434,Autofocus first window when no window is focused in a workspace,"I have firefox, wezterm, and discord autostart in my hyprland config, which are also assigned workspaces 1, 2 and 3 using window rules.

When hyprland starts, workspace 3 becomes the current workspace with discord is focused in it (I assume it's because discord is the window that starts at last)

All of that is fine, but when I switch to workspace 1 or 2 using keybinds, I assume that firefox and wezterm will be FOCUSED in those workspaces, but that is not the case.

So I have to manually focus it by clicking on windows (because I have `follow-mouse` set to `2` since I don't like hover selection). This means I can't type anything in the terminal without focusing it manually.

An option in hyprland to automatically focus the top-left-most window if there is no window focused in a workspace would be appreciated. I am coming from Sway, which has this feature built in, and I don't know why I should have to manually script such a basic feature like this",1
435,Add hot corner functionality,"Hot corners would be a small but useful addition to Hyprland. The idea is that an action occurs when the mouse is moved into a specific corner of the desktop for a certain amount of time (e.g. 200ms), with or without specified modifier keys.

I am only aware of it being implemented on MacOS, but the functions you can assign to it there are very limited so it can only be more potent on Hyprland.

Some functions which are useful to assign to the corners are to run an app launcher, activate a screen locker, toggle a special workspace, cycle through workspaces, or run really any command relevant to a certain workflow.

The overall effect of this feature is that it gives the mouse considerably more power to activate functions in the desktop environment.

437,Allow for Ignoring all Keybinds if Rules are Met,"I wish a window rule be added which will make it ignore any keybinds. This can be useful for RDP software where the remote system uses same keybinds as the local system. So you could add a rule that says ""If X app is Fullscreend, ignore keybinds"".",1
438,An always on top windowrule for floating windows,"Hi, been using Hyprland for just over a week and have been enjoying it a lot so thanks for all your work!

I use the fullscreen mode of hyprland quite often and use apps (i.e. firefox's picture-in-picture mode or custom drop-down terminal from pyprland) that I would want to stay always on top of other windows, but they vanish when I enter fullscreen mode or render behind other floating windows if I switch focus (pin doesn't work if the application was already launched before).

I understand the idea of fullscreen is meant to keep only the said window front and center but in a practical scenario, it would be nice to be able to add a rule to keep certain windows on top.

tl;dr A windowrule to set floating windows to always render on top of other applications in fullscreen or floating mode.",1
439,Show desktop/hide-unhide windows,"Hi!

I think it would be neat if there was a way to hide all the active windows on a workspace and show just the desktop (possibly while a key is being held) and then bring the windows back(once the key press is released).

The use case i'm imagining is to have a eww dashboard instead of a status bar like waybar or hybrid just hanging around on the bottom layer which i could just quickly check for the time/application launch and then go back to work.

Thank you!",1
440,Disable blur for layer,"Currently it doesn't seem to be possible to display blur for a certain layer, only enable it with layerrules. Would it be possible to add a rule to disable it?(I wish to do this as I want to be able to do this to my bar and widgets where I only want the text to display.)",1
441,Monitors: Refer Monitors with hardware-related identifiers,"# Current Functionality
In the config, monitors are referred by the graphic output's ID (e.g. eDP-1)

# Problem and Use Case
As the currently used Identifier usually identifies the output port, but not the monitor itself, configuration for different hardware setups that can be connected to the computer at different times cannot be configured easily.

In my case, I  use my Notebook with three different hardware setups. Two of those are docking stations at different working desks, where different monitors (two each) are present with different desired arrangement and resolutions.
However, on both setups, the IDs of the two monitors are DP-5 and DP-6.
Hence, I cannot configure the individual setups in Hyprland.

# Possible Solution
My proposal is to provide an option to identify the monitors via the EDID fields yielded by `hyprctl monitors`.
Maybe, use an approach similar to window-rulesv2 and call this *monitor-rules*, where arbitrary EDID fields (and maybe a field called `output` or `id` for the old identifier)  may be referred.

A monitor configuration might then be have the form:
`monitorv2=serial:J8J313CPAJ2L,1920x1080@60.000000,2560x0,1`",1
442,Feature request: Add an active field for windowrules,"I've configured an opacity of 0.95 for active windows.

I'd argue that the cursor inactive timeout should take into account all input devices that move the cursor, but even if not it would be nice to be able to configure the devices that keep the cursor ""alive""",1
444,Adding the initialTitle as supported fields in the windowrulev2,"Including the **initialTitle** parameter in the **windowrulev2** configuration allows for greater flexibility in managing applications like Telegram. This is particularly useful when the class name remains the same across different child windows while the title of the window changes based on the selected chat or initiated call. With this configuration, it becomes possible to have Telegram in tile mode while keeping calls within Telegram in float mode.

Here is an example of the configuration:

`windowrulev2 = float, class: ^(org.telegram.desktop)$, initialTitle: ^(?!Telegram$).*`",1

447,Add option to centerwindow to make it center in available space,"Currently, the `centerwindow` dispatcher takes no options and centers the window absolutely on the screen. This doesn't work very well when centering large windows, since the window might be rendered under the system toolbar (e.g. waybar).

It would be nice if `centerwindow` had an option to make it center inside the available work area rather than absolutely centered on the screen.

To illustrate:

![centered-absolutely](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/597206/d0ffbaec-ae4a-48c3-bb21-694b11055d95) ![centered-in-available-space](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/597206/10c3e247-282f-4fe6-9bfe-9e1adb77fbe9)

I have this problem because I use an ultra-wide monitor. Sometimes I only have 1 window in my workspace, in which case it's super awkward to have that window docked. Instead I make it a large floating window and center it, but it looks really awkward when a large window is centered absolutely, and it often overlaps the toolbar.

---

I know I can probably bash script this, and I intend to do that, but I think this option makes a ton of sense to add to `centerwindow`. If you have a large window and a toolbar, you probably never want to center the window absolutely.

Tangential question, does anybody know if it's possible to query the currently available screen space? i.e. the resolution of the currently focused monitor (after scaling) minus the size of all toolbars? Or will I have to hard-code that into my script.",1

450,Feature request: Provide a dispatcher/variable to make floating windows tiled while on the special workspace,"## What should hapen
When a floating window is sent to the special workspace, it should become tiled instead of float. When the same window is send out of the special workspace, it should recover its float state.

## What actually hapen
When a float window is sent to the special workspace, it stays float. You cannot make it tiled unless you send it back to a workspace, manually make it tiled, and then send it again to the special workspace. When you want to send it out of the special workspace, you will have to manually undo the same operation. Which kinda cuts the flow and is prone to mistakes.

## More info
Related to #2161. We said we want to keep the current behavior for users who want to manually fill their special workspace with floating windows. But we also want to provide an alternative for people who want float windows to go 'unfloat' while on the special workspace. Which is likely the most common case of use.",1

503,Workspace switch on mouse exiting screen edge (mouse exiting screen events?),"I would find it very useful if the workspaces could be switched by mouse gestures in the following manner:

When the mouse reaches the right side of the screen and moves a little bit more the active workspace should switch to the next one. On the left side it should switch to the previous in the same manner.

I would like to suggest two possible ways to implement this:

1. Have it as a separate setting in Hyprland. An option to set the desired move distance should exist in order to set the distance that the mouse should move to play the switch animation and actually switch. If the gesture is interrupted before the mouse travels this distance outside the screen the switch should be cancelled. 

2. Implement a way to be able to bind actions to the mouse exiting the screen at the left, right, top and bottom of the screen from the config (perhaps have a global threshold of the traveled distance necessary for the dispatch or have 4 global settings for each one separately or just the top-bottom and right-left pairs, depending on how granular you want this feature to be). This would be more flexible for the general use case, and could, perhaps be the better way to go. This could be used in conjunction with these events to implement the feature I desire and give users more flexibility at the same time.
This could look something like:
```
bind=mouse_left_exit,workspace,-1
bind=mouse_right_exit,workspace,+1
```
The names could be refined to `mouse_left_exit_screen` or something more reasonable, but I think you get the idea.
This second idea could also allow these gestures to combine with modifier keys, allowing for even more flexibility.",1

}
master {
    bind = $m, J, layoutmsg, cyclenext
    bind = $m, K, layoutmsg, cycleprev

```

Currently binds inside layout blocks are valid but they apply in all layouts (so the above results in a double bind on `$m [JK]`). For per-layout bindings it's necessary to `unbind`/`bind` in the layout switch dispatch. 

Enabling this functionality would add some complexity to the implementation, either storing mappings for each layout or re-evaluating the config file on layout switch. So maybe not worth it, unless somebody wants it enough to implement.",1

In Sway I have been using Kanshi and it has been working, but in Hyprland it appears to be crashing. My current workaround is to treat the situation manually:

Whenever I am plugging in a monitor, I disable the laptop's one via `hyprctl keyword monitor ""eDP-1,disable""` and whenever I am about to unplug the former, I run `hyprctl keyword monitor ""eDP-1, highrr, auto, 2""` so that the system is not left without a monitor after the unplugging.

516,Floating layout,"Similar to dwm's `<><` mode where all windows in a single workspace are set to floating.

Some customizable option ideas to supplement this feature:
- Set new floating windows to open next to each other, like in GNOME
- Set new floating windows to open on top of each other with a slight offset, like with XFCE
- Floating layout available as a default workspace layout
- ~choose for only popups (small windows <= some size) to open in floating mode~ I believe it does this already


Why?
- Programs that create many continuous popups destroy the tiled layout
- Many people manually float each window for a ricing screenshot
- Tiling is not efficient for workspaces with many GUI applications that are not meant to be maximized or squished into a tiny dwindle container
- the current workaround for floating as default (`float,.*; move cursor -50% -50%,.*`) is not very efficient
- new floating windows opening next to each other is better than centering 10+ floating windows on top of each other and having to drag each one away

and there's some work like [tdrop](https://github.com/noctuid/tdrop), it is independent of DE and application and can make every window act as the above drop-down terminal but now currently works only for X, and may need some workarounds for specific WM, I have encountered some issues like multi-monitor support in `bspwm` and flicking in `qtile` previously.

IMO the best practice is making the DE(WM) built-in support, letting the WM decide how the best behavior for the ""drop down"" application, like `qtile`,
according to the [docs](https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/config/groups.html) :
> ScratchPad is a special - by default invisible - group which acts as a container for DropDown configurations. A DropDown can be configured to spawn a defined process and bind thats process' window to it. The associated window can then be shown and hidden by the lazy command dropdown_toggle() (see [Lazy objects](https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/config/lazy.html#lazy)) from the ScratchPad group. Thus - for example - your favorite terminal emulator turns into a quake-like terminal by the control of Qtile.

> If the DropDown window turns visible it is placed as a floating window on top of the current group. If the DropDown is hidden, it is simply switched back to the ScratchPad group.

i would like to suggest the feature, that if using a `relative workspace to monitor (m+1)` argument in a `workspace` or `movetoworkspace/movetoworkspacesilent` dispatcher, a new workspace should be created instead of doing nothing in the case of the `workspace` dispatcher.
As an alternative `monitor+next` and `monitor+previous` as a new workspace choice may also be an option, although they imo do not differ that much from `m+1` and `m-1`.

This could be beneficial to users in a multi-monitor setup, as they could just move back and forth between workspaces on a monitor instead of having to assign workspaces to outputs or remember the assigned workspaces.

    This option determines what to do when attempting to focus over the edge of a container. If set to no, the

568,Dispatcher for alternating between most recent window in the focus history on the current workspace,"This issue technically breaks rule about extending Hyprland with scripts, you can close it without reading further *(if you're a monster!)*.  

___
  
I'm surprised Hyprland doesn't offer functionality to essentially Alt-Tab between windows as seen in KDE, Gnome, Awesome, etc.

At first it seems that a simple solution would be to alternate between `cyclenext` and `cyclenext, prev`, like so:  
```sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash

TOGGLE=/tmp/hypr-alt-tab.toggle

if [ ! -e $TOGGLE ]; then
    touch $TOGGLE
    hyprctl dispatch cyclenext """"
else
    rm $TOGGLE
    hyprctl dispatch cyclenext prev
fi
```

But it has issues:
<p>1. Changing workspaces has a chance to break the behavior</p>
<p>2. Changing window focus in any other way has a chance to break the behavior</p>
<p>4. Cosmic rays screwing with the if statement just like they with this list index ;o so you know it's a real issue!</p>

___

To make an actual, working version would require a somewhat heavy script:
1. Subscribe to socket, listen for `activewindow>>>`, call `hyprctl activewindow` to grab the address *(not sure why it's not included in the socket message already)*

2. Segregate history based on workspaces, requires parsing `hyprctl clients`

3. Upkeep saved adresses, another parsing of `hyprctl clients` on many socket updates *(window moving, killing, etc.)* to discard old addresses or move them around based on new workspace

Why? Because I suck at coding and I want you to do it for me. But seriously... this is a pretty basic feature that would greatly benefit Hyprland users if included :')

570,"Resizing psudotiled window only affects it's ""tilied"" size","One common usecase of resizing pseudotiled windows for me is making a single window narrower on ultrawide screen, without making it floating. It's something that I used a lot on bspwm, and, sadly, it seems to be impossible on Hyprland.
It looks like on hyprland in dwindle layout `resizewindow` for tiled windows controls window's _borders_ relative to other windows, and only in the direction it was split. So it resizes like a tiled window, but actual window size depends on the size of it in floating mode, making it impossible to change, at least with a mouse.
However, in bspwm, window size for pseudotiled windows actually controlled ""floating"" size, and instead it's ""tiled"" size was impossible to change directly. However, you could still force the pseudotiled window into a smaller window or give it more space if you resize other windows, so both were possible.
Sorry If I'm vague, it's kinda hard to explain. If my explanation is not good enough, just play around with pseudotiled windows in bspwm and in Hyprland and you'll see what I mean.  
What I'm getting at: would it be possible to change the behavior of `resizewindow` for pseudotiled windows, so it would change window's ""floating"" size? Or add another, specific mouse bind to specifically only interact with floating size of windows?

but the part that it is missing on hyprland is that when workspace 1 would move to 1st monitor, the workspace I was on in monitor1 would go to monitor2, but the way it is now the behaviour is somewhat random. 

There is the dispatcher swapactiveworkspaces, but that doesn't really suit the functionality I'm looking for.

My idea is that a pinned tiled window would stay in the same position across all workspaces on the same monitor. That way I'd be able to switch only parts of the current screen and keep the pinned windows there. The size of the windows wouldn't have to remain the same, just putting them in a similar position and then preserving the layout for the respective workspace would be nice. A pinned window might be in different positions and sizes if you rearrange them in a specific workspace.

The only issue I still have is that it's currently not ideal on a (second) vertical/portrait monitor, where the master and slave areas are split vertically, leading to two narrow areas.

A possible solution to solve this and make the master layout more powerful would be if the user could choose (per workspace) where to place the master area. We could envision a `masterplacement` command for the layoutmsg dispatcher The current implementation would correspond to `masterplacement left`, but additionally users could opt for `right` (master right, slaves left split horizontally ), `top` (master top, slaves on bottom split vertically) and `bottom` (master bottom, slaves on top split vertically).

Has some relation with #622, which wasn't deemed feasible in the current implementation; this would address the issue whilst sticking to a single layout. 

I might have a try at implementing this myself if the idea is welcomed...",1
621,Disable VSync,"The ability to disable VSync has just been merged into the Wayland repository.

Of course the change is brand new so this shouldn't be changed immediately, but I don't know how much needs to be changed for that, so in case its a deep change I opened this feature request early.",1

625,Option to enable absolute cursor position.,"It would be nice to have the possibility to use the touchpad in absolute mode, meaning that when I touch the upper left corner on the touchpad the cursor jumps to the upper left corner of the screen and so on (technically like a touchscreen).

This could be done with a config options such as `absolute_touchpad=yes` possibly in the *input/touchpad* section.


Due to having weird raw coordinates on some touchpads it should also be possible to set minimum and maximum thresholds on the trackpad's raw values, thus setting and/or limiting the area used on it (using it totally from edge to edge may also be inconvenient on some laptops). This would imply the existence of a few options in the *input/touchpad* session, such as `touchpad_min_x`, `touchpad_min_y`, `touchpad_max_x`, `touchpad_max_y` to restrict the used range of the trackped as mentioned.

These absolute coordinates should also be able to work together with gestures. I would expect the two-finger up-down swipe to still scroll as normal, despite having absolute coordinates.

Finally, as a bonus `hyprctl` could have an option to display raw values from the touchpad to help with the configuration of the usable range, though this is not necessary because we alreadhy have `evtest` to do that for us.

Unfortunately I am not familiar with hyprland's codebase.",1

With current behaviour, starting at the big window and focusing right, down, left, right would select the _top-right_ window. Having just come from bspwm and i3, this surprised me; I'd have expected it to have selected the _bottom-right_ window, as that was the window on the right of the big one that was last focused.

633,Disabling animations on specific layers,"## Issue

I've been trying to disable animations for rofi, specifically. I'm using `rofi-lbonn-wayland-git`, which renders rofi in Layer 3:

```
$ hyprctl layers
Monitor DP-1:
	Layer level 0:
		Layer 3184fd10: xywh: 1920 0 1920 1080, namespace: hyprpaper
	Layer level 1:
	Layer level 2:
		Layer 31816a70: xywh: 1920 0 1920 35, namespace: waybar

	Layer level 2:
		Layer 31f24a50: xywh: 0 0 1920 35, namespace: waybar
	Layer level 3:
		Layer 31fb9c70: xywh: 480 320 960 474, namespace: rofi

```

I've tried setting a window rule with noanim, but that obviously didn't work since rofi isn't a window in this case, but a layer.

Is there currently a way to disable animations for specific layers? If not, would it be feasible to port some of the `windowrule`s to a `layerrule` config option?

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install `rofi-lbonn-wayland-git`
2. Try using `windowrulev2 = noanim, class:^(rofi)$` to disable all animations for rofi
3. Open rofi

## Expected outcome

The ability to disable animations, in this instance, for specific layers

## Noted outcome

Animations still play. No apparent way to disable them in the config, except disabling all animations in general.",1
634,Option to not blur fully transparent pixels,"As far as I could find, there's no way to disable blur for fully transparent pixels, I think it'd be really useful :)",1
635,Emulating some ion3 behaviour,"I'm currently still an [ion3](https://tuomov.iki.fi/software/ion/) user, and regularly check if there are some new developments allowing me to switch to wayland - hyprland was the first one that looks like I'm fine with it on my notebook (the scratchpad helped a lot with that..), though there are a few issues there still, and I don't see yet how I can use it on my multi display workstation. 

This is a collection of those things - some of which may already be possible via scripting, and I just don't see how, while for others the answer might be ""write a new layout manager"". I can split off individual items to separate issues if they're deemed sensible on their own.

1. tagging and attaching a window
Ion3 allows me to tag a window, go somewhere else, and then attach whichever window is tagged. Attaching makes it lose its tag. This _might_ be scriptable already, but I don't quite see how.

2. float splits
Ion3 allows 'float splits', both horizontal and vertical. For those splits the active frame overlaps the inactive frame(s) fully or partially, depending on the active frames size. This is very useful on devices with a small screen - I can work in a frame covering most of the screen while keeping just enough of another frame visible to see if something interesting has happened, without resizing it.

4. static splits
On my workstation I typically have a static 3x3 split one one screen, a more complex layout on a second, and the others keep changing (i.e., would work fine with hyprlands dynamic splits). I currently don't see how I could do that, and ""needs a static layouter"" might be the answer here.

5. titles in tab groups
There's #954 open about titles - which I also think are usually stupid. The one exception is tab containers - there it sometimes is useful to have an overview of what is inside of the container.

6. query module
Ion has a built in query module which allows ssh/app launcher/editing files/... - I've replaced most of that by wofi scripts now. The one bit where things are lacking currently is window manager control - ion3 is fully controllable via embedded lua, so I can just open a query and interact with the WM.
Most (if not all) of this might be solvable with launcher+external scripting, though it looks to be a bit clumbsy in some times - this might benefit from either having an internal query for this, or having hyprctl to be a bit more friendly for building completion output for launchers.

7. tab groups splitting
This is the main annoyance I currently have on my notebook - I often end up in a situation with a group at full screen height, and two frames at half height each next to it. Then I would like to have the group only fill half the screen, and another frame either above or below. Currently it seems I have to ungroup, open frame, regroup

8. ability to cancel operation from a submap
In ion3 I can enter resize/move modes with a submap, with similar behaviour as in hyprland. The big difference is that I have the option of pressing Enter to accept the resize operation, or Esc to leave, reverting the resize.",1

638,Title bars?,"Right now I use Waybar with the window title module, but that is not as flexible as title bars. Far from being [useless eye candy](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hypr/issues/49), titlebars let the user manage windows with only the mouse, which is important for accessibility. It's a lot to ask for but no rush:

- show window title
- show window status: right now there's no visual indicator for fullscreen 1 windows, and the tabbed/grouped indicator border is narrow and hard to see. It seems natural to make the indicator borders bigger to make them title bars, since they're already rendered above the window border.
- left click/scroll to switch tabbed window 
- left click/drag title bar to move window
- bind mouse buttons (eg right click title bar to toggle floating, middle click to close)
- toggle title bars per window/globally",1

- [ ] Four-finger pinch/expand to zoom in and out of the screen (currently I use hyprpicker to get a sort of zoom effect, but it's not practical)

646,Workspace improvements,"I'm running awesomewm currently and been playing around with Hyprland to probably switch to. Here are some workspace suggestions, which I think might be useful to others too.

## 1. Show empty workspaces (waybar)
It would be nice to have empty workspaces shown in waybar too. 

## 2. Styling for active workspace even when the monitor has not the focus (waybar)
As per the waybar documentation, `#workspaces button.active` (hyprland) sets the styling for the active workspace. However, this styling is only applied on the focused monitor, but not on other monitors. Do open/active workspaces of non-focused monitors have a class assigned to it?

## 3. Workspaces per output, aka tags, aka groups

This one leads to a lot of confusion, since not everyone can explain what the actual demand is. But I'll try me best. In short, it's basically how awesomewm handles it.

Let's say I have 4 monitors (DP-1... DP-4) and **n** workspaces  (A, B, C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q).
Now, I'd expect each output to show all 3 workspaces (A, B, C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q). When I configure `bind=SUPER,7,workspace,7` it should switch to **G**, but only on the currently focused monitor.

iirc, there's some mentioning about workspace groups in the wayland specs, but I'm not sure whether it covers this usecase or not.

Keychords are keybindings that can be chained to one another. A famous example is Emacs’ keybind for opening a file `C-x C-f` (read it as Ctrl-x then Ctrl-f).

### Why keychords?
While simple keybindings are easy to implement and fast to press, their number can become quickly limited on a keyboard, especially when trying to keep things organized. Accidentally hit alt when typing Super+q? Guess your computer will shut down instead of just going to sleep.
While keychords require a bit more hand movements, the amount of assignable keybindings becomes virtually limitless while allowing the user to keep their keybindings organized.

### Additional and implementation ideas
Keybindings could be organized in keymaps which could be accessed by other keybindings. I believe this is how i3 handles their own keychords.

670,Split-direction preselection,"Feature:
-----------
As a user coming from bspwm I would really like to see split-direction preselection support in Hyperland.

Currently Hyperland decides whether to split horizontally or vertically based on the window W/H ratio and after that chooses between top/bottom or left/right based on the pointer position.

I would like to see a dispatcher that allows manually setting the split direction for the next opened window.

When `preserve_split` is `true` any of the direction left, right, up and down can be preselected. Without `preserve_split` only left/right or only up/down can be preselected based on the W/H ration of the window.

Hyperland could visualize an active preselection by drawing a rectangle over the area where the new window will be placed.
An active preselection could be removed by either calling the dispatcher again with the same direction or by a special clear parameter to the dispatcher.


Scenario example:
------------------------
The user config contains
```
preserve_split=true
bind=SUPER_CTRL,left,splitpresel,l
bind=SUPER_CTRL,right,splitpresel,r
bind=SUPER_CTRL,up,splitpresel,u
bind=SUPER_CTRL,down,splitpresel,d
```

The user opens a window (window1)
Window1 takes up the whole screen space.

The user opens another window (window2) while window1 is active and the pointer is in the left half of window1
Window1 takes up the right half of the screen. Window2 takes up the left half of the screen

The user presses Super + Ctrl + left while window2 is active.
Window1 takes up the right half of the screen. Window2 takes up the left half of the screen. A rectangle is overlayed above the left half of window2.

The user opens a new window (window3).
Window1 takes up the right half of the screen. Window2 takes up the 3rd quarter from the right of the screen. Window3 takes up the left quarter of the screen.

reload means to rerun the script to align the state on sway reload

However, I am unable to set a windowrule for a specific window (or web page) for firefox. When I open htop or anything similar it allows me to see the original command it was ran with, arguments and all. But when I run hyprctl clients, there isn't any unique information for that window (apart from maybe the title which is dynamic based on what day/week it is). A possible fix for this is allowing exec to run commands with arguments to tell hyprland where to put the resulting window (I'm not sure if this is too complex for hyprland though).

688,Better workspace management with multiple displays/monitors,"Hi, first of all thanks for this project, I'm in love with it.

As the title suggests, I think there is room for improvement when managing multiple displays.

Supose that we have two monitors, monitor_1 (left) and monitor_2 (right) 

If I'm looking at the monitor_1 and I switch to a  workspace that is in the monitor_2, it woud be nice (in my opinion) if the worskpace that was in monitor_2 got swapped with the previous workspace that was in monitor_1.This way I don't have to constantly turn my head to a different monitor. I know this sound silly, but it makes a huge difference in usability (again, a personal opinion). In summary, the priority where the workspace should go is the current monitor of the focused window, and not the current monitor of the workspace that were are trying to access.

I'm aware of the Dispatchers `moveworkspacetomonitor` and `swapactiveworkspaces`, but couldn't figure it out how to solve this problem.

Should be something like this:

(I'm using monitor_1)

**if** workspace_desired is in monitor_2 && showing_in_monitor_2: `swapactiveworkspaces` 1 2
**else if** workspace_desired is in monitor_2: `moveworkspacetomonitor` workspace_desired 1,  `moveworkspacetomonitor` previous_workspace 2.
**else**: `workspace` desired_workspace

That said, is this achievable through hyprctl (maybe with some bash scripting) or just tweaking the config file? If so, any help would be appreciated

696,Pinned windows in combination with fullscreen,"With a pinned floating window, and a fullscreen window on the active workspace,
if you movefocus to the pinned window, it fullscreens.
While it is nice to be able to fullscreen a pinned window sometimes, 
the automatic fullscreening when moving to the pinned window is unintuitive (at least for me).
I'm not totally shure how i would approach this.
One possible sulution would be to treat fullscreen calls different for pinned windows, so that a focused pinned window will fullscreen by the fullscreen command, but not by moving the focus to that window on a fullscreen-workspace.
It would be sad to lose the ability to fullscreen a pinned window, so that  unpinning, fullscreening, unfullscreening, pinning again would be nessesary for quickly having a broader look inside that window.
There could be other maybe better solutions, i just think the actual behavior is confusing.

It's quite confusing to use togglegroup from that fullscreen state because it's not visible at that moment which windows are children of the visible window.
The only way to know would be to memorize it, and i don't think that would be very common.
A group that contains all windows on a workspace looks the same as a fullscreen window, but the behaviour of togglegroup is completely different and it's nessesary to be able to toggle that group. 
I think a reasonable solution would be to disable togglegroup if a fullscreen window is shown, and maybe even disable fullscreen if a group spans the full screen anyways.

702,[Feature Request] Order named workspaces,"Hi! First of all thank you for your great work. I'm coming from sway and I was wondering if there could be an option to set the order of named workspaces.

Currently named workspaces (created with `workspace name:MyName`) are given an id in the order they are created, from -1337 and downwards. This means the last named workspace created will always be to the far left. 

I like to have my named workspaces always in the same order, mail, then passwords, then web, then dev. In sway I was able to do that by setting the workspace names with `ID:name`, for instance `0:mail`, `1:passwords`, `2:web`, `3:dev` which would put them in that order. In Hyprland it doesn't seem to be possible to change the ID of a named workspace. 

Would you consider allowing setting the ID of a named workspace, or even better, provide some command to set the named workspaces order? An command similar to wsbind could be used to bind a list of workspace to a in a certain order for instance. 

For instance one would use `wsorder=name:mail, name:passwords, name:web, name:develop` which would then assign the ids of those named workspaces in that particular order when they're created. 

Another perhaps simpler way would be to add the syntax `ID:name` to create a workspace or assign a window to a workspace like this: 
```
windowrule=workspace -1:dev,foot
windowrule=workspace -2:web,firefox
windowrule=workspace -3:passwords,keepassxc
windowrule=workspace -4:mail,thunderbird

Whenever a GUI app is launched through the terminal, the compositor/WM will instantly hide the terminal window and spawn the GUI app window in its place.

## A basic implementation
We can have a window rule for marking a window as a terminal application. Then, whenever such a process tries to spawn another window, we can simply have the new window swallow the terminal window.

724,Add window{open/close/move} IPC events,"I am making a custom status bar using the `eww` framework. And I need to know when windows open, close and move between workspaces.

Open/close is pretty straightforward. I tried to emit IPC events in `Events::listener_mapWindow`/`Events::listener_unmapWindow` and it worked fine. 

Move, on the other hand, is tricky, because `CWindow.m_iWorkspaceID` is public and is being changed all over the place. There are at least 3 places where I need to emit the ""move"" IPC event:
1. Move window via keybind
2. Drag window and switch workspace
3. Pick window, switch workspace and drop it (without mouse movement)

I suggest hiding `CWindow.m_iWorkspaceID` behind getter/setter. Then it will be possible to emit the event just in the setter.

726,Add support for dimming windows,"Just like the [Decoration options](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Basic-Config/#decoration) `active_opacity` and `inactive_opacity`, could you add `active_brightness` and `inactive_brightness`? For example, [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) (an X11 compositor) has the config option `inactive-dim` as a float from 0.0 to 1.0 to set the brightness for inactive windows.",1
727,Monitor Cycling,"Though this can be somewhat hacked around, it would be nice to have a relative ID option for monitor selection in the configuration identical to how workspaces function. Seems like it would make the configuration feel a little more consistent between monitors and workspaces.

This way it would be fairly trivial to configure a single keybind for cycling through monitors, or in the case of two monitors, swapping between the two. 

Alternatively, if the direction for monitors cycled back around, such that going right on the right most monitor would go leftmost, it would make a similar setup also trivial. But that feels like it would break existing configurations and/or cause more unintended consequences.

728,Option for `blurls` to look better with rounded corners/fully transparent pixels,"`blurls` is great for my notification and bar styling, but right now I can't really put rounded corners on them as Hyprland still blurs the pixels that aren't really part of the window (corner radius on `dunst` exaggerated to show the effect):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9727338/184680755-f44cc95f-7f22-40a7-82a9-11c51f601f6f.png)

In all of my cases this would be fixable by simply not blurring pixels that are completely transparent, but there might be some better way of achieving this that I'm not thinking of.

Apologies if there already is a way around this!",1
729,Save Window Layouts; Re-Open later,"Using `hyprctl clients -j`will list all windows and their respective workspaces. I guess I could write a script that parses the JSON for the relevant information, save it, then use it re-open the layout later. However, I'm not sure if this is the best approach. 

Is there a better way I am missing?",1
730,Better Touch Implementation,"As things are now, Hyprland presents a vary basic touch implementation.
On 2in1 laptops you can use single touch and multitouch, as when you scroll (and zoom) firefox or navigate through the timeline in mpv, but that's about it.
For some reason, ""overlays"" (sorry, unfortunately I don't know their technical name) as waybar and the bitwarden pop up in firefox are untouchable: they ""see"" they see the cursor on top of them, but instead of the element that the cursor is sitting on top being selected, the area beneath them is. For example: on firefox, if I try to open Bitwarden's applet and to select one of my logins, instead the underneath ""Fork"" button of github is selected. 
 And even when using touch to control firefox, the mouse's cursor remains always visible, and when multitouching there are some strange artifacts. On gnome, kde and sway the issue isn't present.

Sorry for this long comment.",1
731,Monocle alternative to full screen. (and automatic monocle?),"I have a large monitor, and full screen is often too much. Other window managers like bspwm have a monocle layout, which I think is just all the windows stacked on top of each other and can be cycled or something like that. 

However, my primary use case: if I have just one or two windows, I'd prefer a different layout, with much larger gaps. Ideally, I could also toggle this layout to get a pseudo full screen effect on workspaces with many windows. 

I realize that I could probably manually with sockets (https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Expanding-functionality), but I'm not quite sure how to do so. Perhaps expanding this wiki (https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/IPC) would be enough to allow me to create such scripts. ",1

The current workaround I achieved is by running some little bash scripts using `awk` or `sed` to change config file related to gaps on the fly (because the config is reloaded automatically anyway)
but I just imagine if it possible using the official way.

Second, is it also possible to for example resize the window by just holding the keys a couple seconds, instead of pressing it multiple times?

736,Match multiple properties with window rules,"Hi! I would like to make all floating windows opened by the program with the title `nheko` fullscreen by default (and have no animation when going fullscreen). I haven't found a way to do this with current windowrules.

```

	size: 895,1088
	workspace: 2 (2)

737,Confusing ID values for named workspaces,"When number for workspace set as ID, everything is good: right order of workspaces and hyprland's ID to workspace name mapping.
But, according to
https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/src/helpers/Workspace.hpp
when workspace created as named, ID becomes negative (-1337), which slightly breaks waybar's wlr/workspaces:
1. sort-by-coordinates works incorrectly
2. I dunno why, but ID's assigned a bit unevenly (see below)

So, the user is limited to two options in waybar:
1. Indexed workspaces + sort-by-coordinate with no ws names
2. Named workspaces and alphabetical order and no control over ws order 

hyprctl workspaces:
```
workspace ID -1337 (photo) on monitor eDP-1:
   windows: 2
   hasfullscreen: 0
 workspace ID -1340 (dev) on monitor eDP-1:
   windows: 1
   hasfullscreen: 0
 workspace ID -1341 (web) on monitor eDP-1:
   windows: 1
   hasfullscreen: 0
 workspace ID -1342 (social) on monitor eDP-1:
   windows: 1
   hasfullscreen: 0
 workspace ID -99 (special) on monitor eDP-1:
   windows: 1
   hasfullscreen: 0
```

It seems like order of workspaces creation does not follows order of commands in .conf file.
Also it affect workspace sliding effect, e.g. changing with mouse scroll in one direction (1>2>3>4) reveals workspaces from different directions.

Sorry if I wasn't clear or just didn't get feature-not-a-bug)) (or just stupid)


Related part of config file (there's no any other modifications for workspaces in file):

workspace = eDP-1,name:social

740,[animations] minimum size option for scale,"# Problem
When windows scale onto the screen when at the start of the animation they are really small they look pixialted and bad
# Solution
Is it possible to have an optional minimum scale option for the scale animation eg:
```
animation=windows,1,5,scale,70% # <- last value is minimum scale option

This would mean that windows start there scale animation at 70% so the animation looks more like it does on gnome",1
741,Create a new workspace between workspaces,"I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but this is a feature I expected when I read ""fully dynamic workspaces"" in the feature list.

As far as I can tell right now, the only way to create a new workspace is by giving it a name or an ID.
For the lifetime of the workspace, the workspace's ID cannot change.
This means that if I have workspaces 1 and 2 open, I can't create a ""workspace 1.5"".
(Another side-effect is that I cannot reorder workspaces.)

I think this system of ""static workspaces"" is rigid and inflexible, since it requires you to ""pre-allocate"" all of your future workspaces in your mind.

For this proposed feature to work well under this system, workspace IDs would need to be automatically managed: destroying a workspace would need to collapse the IDs of any higher workspaces.

This could technically be implemented using IPC, but I feel like this feature is close enough to Hyprland's goals for it to potentially be a core feature.

(I think having a ""dynamic workspaces system"" in this sense would also allow for nice features down the road, like an interactive ""workspaces overview"" that allows you to create and reorder workspaces or move windows across workspaces.)",1
742,`movewindow` dispatcher to have option for next/previous window,It makes sense to navigate the master/stack layout with the `cyclenext` dispatcher for next/previous windows. It also makes sense to want to move windows in the same way - currently `movewindow` only accepts u/d/l/r,1

744,Option to disable rounding ,"rounding=0 in the config does not disable rounding

745,Improve usability of workspace swipe,"While using the workspace swipe feature I ran into two distinct issues:
1: If I am on workspace 10, with windows open in all other workspaces I need to swipe 9 times or use keyboard shortcut to get back to workspace 1.
2: I am unable to open up an empty workspace.

The first issue can be fixed by adding a config option to allow wrapping the workspace swipe gesture.

The second issue is a bit more difficult to fix in an intuitive way. One way is to add in a config option to allow actually swapping between workspaces and not workspaces with windows, though when the user is not trying to open a blank workspace this feature becomes annoying. Another is to do as mentioned in #385 and open a new workspace when swiping on the final workspace, though this solution runs into a problem if workspace 1 and 3 have windows open. In this scenario it would be impossible to open workspace 2, and workspace 4 would instead be opened. Some logic could be implemented to circumvent this but that logic would likely cause the workspace number to teleport in an unnatural way. Due to this, I believe these are the best ways of addressing this issue:
- Seperate gesture (different amount of fingers) for switching between workspaces and workspaces with windows.
- Configurable key to hold down when using the gesture, that changes the behavior.
- Way to add a keybind to toggle between different behaviors.",1
746,Default size for floating windows,"# Problem
When you float a window it stays the same size which makes the fact that it has floated unobvios and means it covers a tremendios portion of the screen so I have to resize (and move) it.

I think that there should be an option for how a window will resize and reposition itself when you float it EG: when I float a window it moves to 50x50 and resies to 450x600",1

748,Deferent animations for windows move on automatic resizing vs windows move on manuel resizing,"I cannot create a window bounce effect without making windows have a glitchy resize animation.
If I add
```

animations {
    enabled=1
    animation=windows,1,5,overshot,slide
   animation=windowsMove,1,5,overshot,default # the overshot animtion here cuases windows to be scaled when resized manually (see https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/437)
}
```
Then I get this problem https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/437
I think to fix this there should be 2 windowsMove suboptions;
- windowsMoveAutomatic (when windows are moved with the keyboard)

= and =
- windowsMoveManuel (when windows are move with the mouse)

This means I can have the manuel option set to disable and the autoamtic option set to my overwhoot bezier",1

Currently I'm using `follow_mouse=2` which is almost perfect, as I can interact with windows (e.g., scroll within them) using the mouse without losing keyboard focus of the window I need, but clicking on the window (e.g. to switch to the next song, or using mouse to copy tex by selecting it) still switches focus.",1
750,movewindow and movefocus behaviour when fullscreen,"The behaviour of these two functions in combination with a fullscreen window is quite confusing.
I think movewindow should be disabled if a window is shown fullscreen.
If i could choose how movefocus behaves with a fullscreen window, i would vote for a fullscreen-mode like behaviour,
where the window that gains focus becomes the new fullscreen window.
If that is not desired, movefocus should be disabled aswell i guess.
What do you think?

756,[Master Stack] Additional commands for master layout,"I was wondering if you could implement two commands that would drastically improve managing the master layout:

1. Swap with Master Command
Could we get a command to swap the current window with the master window?

2. Cycling Command (Related to #401)
The default behavior of the mod-J and mod-K keys in DWM and XMonad is to cycle through windows down the master pane, then down the stack, and the back to the master pane. Could we get a command that implements this feature?",1
757,[Master Stack] Support multiple windows in master pane of master/stack layout,"XMonad has a feature where you can increment/decrement the number of windows that are on the left pane in the master/stack layout. This gives extra flexibility to the layout.

Supporting this in Hyprland would require adding two extra commands: one to increment and one to decrement the count (or one command with a parameter). If the count goes to zero, the left pane vanishes and is replaced by an expanded stack.",1
758,Toggle window opacity via keyboard shortcut,"Sometimes my default window rule for having the window opacity set makes

I like this feature because I believe gaps are only necessary when there is more than 1 window, so you can easily distinguish them apart. When there is only 1 window, I don't want any gaps so I can dedicate the whole screen to that window.

If this is possible with a script, I would like to know about it.

786,[Feature Request] Runtime configuration options?,"WMs like bspwm or [hlwm](https://herbstluftwm.org/herbstluftwm.html) exposes everything for the configuration into shell (from sockets). This makes it easy to test out changes when windows are opened and things are running.

Hlwm also offers a locking mechanism where if the hlwm is started with `--locked`, all the style changes are deferred until `hc unlock` is called. That way default themes are not applied and after everything is queued, things start drawing. Can also manually lock and unlock with `hc lock` and `hc unlock` in case we want to do multiple changes and stay responsive/efficient while doing so, as sockets have latency (e.g. switching light/dark mode of multiple things borders / bg / frame / etc).

How cool would it be if we're able to configure & test out stuffs at runtime (with `hyprctl` which already allows socket talking as I see), without exiting the session or try to run different wm in another tty, and get the results seen in-eye at the exact moment.",1

So I had to invest a lot of time to make this work so I think it would be helpful to add this info to the documentation.

1. Install portal package for wlroots in fedora:
`sudo dnf install xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
3. Add 'hyprland' to 'UseIn' at /usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/portals/wlr.portal:
4. Add to hyperland configfile:
`exec-once=systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY SWAYSOCK`
`exec-once=hash dbus-update-activation-environment 2>/dev/null && dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_ DISPLAY SWAYSOCK`

827,Focus next WS on monitor,"Last one for a while, I promise.

When using multiple monitors, one often wants to navigate the WS on the current monitor only, and keep the other monitor focused on the same WS. With the current implementation of ""workspace,+1 | -1"", I am going through all WS in order, and thus potentially changing the WS on the other monitor if I go through WS on it. Of course, I can use ""workspace,N"" directly, but for my workflow I am used to next/previous WS (which means I don't have to reach up to the number keys and think it over, arrow keys are a shorter reach).

This would be done by implementing a ""focusNextWSonCurrentMonitor"" (or prev). Of course, that would mean to keep a registry of what WS are on what monitor, but you probably have that already :-)

**Alternatively and probably a better idea** than a separate command, 
```bash
workspace,nextOnMonitor | prevOnMonitor
```
might be better.

An extension of this for a move:
```bash
movetoworkspace,nextOnMonitor | prevOnMonitor
```
would also be very useful

All this would not break the current behaviour, just add a very useful functionality.

Also, there is always a vertical line of complete separation down the screen, meaning I cannot have a window go all the way across the bottom of the screen when any other windows are present.

1. Named workspaces (tags):
```
 so we can store multiple workspaces > [0..9]
 ```
2. ability to map keybindings by `hyprctl`:  
```
by default we map keys for `default` group of workspaces and by executing script for switching to another group, we remap this keybindings for another set of workspaces and unbind some, if there is such
```
like, 
```conf
# by default
bind=SUPER,1,workspace,default.1
bind=SUPER,2,workspace,default.2
bind=SUPER,3,workspace,default.3
...
```

and for switching
```bash
...
hyprctl bind SUPER,1,workspace,work.ide
hyprctl bind SUPER,2,workspace,work.web
hyprctl unbind SUPER,3

855,Allow Disabling Displays,"There are times where it is necessary to turn off a display. For example, on a VR headset, you do not want it acting as part of the desktop, so it is best to turn it off. It also seems to break certain parts of my main monitor's tiling while I have my HMD plugged in. 

From what I could figure out, displays seem to be initialized in `src/config/ConfigManager.ccp` at around line 140. I assume a condition could be made to check if the monitor's resolution (in the config file) is 0x0, and then make a condition to not initialize it. ",1
856,Support for wayland unstable protocol linux_dmabuf_unstable_v1,"**Describe in detail your idea.**

Protocol: [linux_dmabuf_unstable_v1](https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/main/unstable/linux-dmabuf/linux-dmabuf-unstable-v1.xml)

Whenever I run `mpvpaper -o ""--loop-playlist -v"" DP-3 ~/Pics/wallpaper/gifs/lazy_mario.gif` I get the following output.

```bash
Cannot load libcuda.so.1
 (+) Video --vid=1 (gif 1920x1080 10.000fps)

######  [Ignore the libcuda error](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper/issues/2)

[mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper) will play the gif and then after the gif is over it crashes (the `loop-playlist` flag should loop the gif).",1

Thank you!",1
858,Tabbed containers,"**Describe in detail your idea.**
My primary usecase of i3/sway is being able to ~~stack~~ tab windows in a container. I have a super ultra wide monitor and I have 3 columns of windows with my 'main' window in the middle. I always make this a ~~stacked~~ tabbed container so I can easily switch from my web browser / terminal / steam / game all being in the middle of my monitor. It's also nice just to declutter spare windows.

It has similar usecases as workspaces, but since my monitor is so wide I don't need an entire new screen of windows, I just want to easily repurpose my main area.

This is important to me and I'm unlikely to switch to this as my main wm unless this is a feature. Other than that though, it really is quite a nice experience! About time we had a fresh wm!",1
859,Mouse constraints/locking isn't implemented.,"Especially games, which use the cursor for looking around, e.g. shooters, minecraft, etc. Cannot lock the mouse and thus are unplayable.",1
860,Forgotten cd in Wiki/Installation,"**Describe in detail your idea.**
Hi! I was installing your awesome work and found out a small issue with the docs.
https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland/wiki/Installation

Issue is very simple, there's no cd after git clone so people will get the following error:
``make: *** No rule to make target 'install'.  Stop.``
<img width=""331"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83316880/161871844-ba9aef4f-ff92-4996-9552-b0d18e4431bb.png"">

So it should be:
```
git clone https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland
cd Hyprland
sudo make install
```",1
861,Nvidia support?,"I couldn't find an answer to this in the wiki. Do you plan - if it doesn't as is - to add a flag or some level of support for running Hyprland with the propriertary Nvidia drivers? Since this seems to be based on wl-roots it is perhaps possible to add a flag like Sway has --my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia? 

Since Nvidia do not open source their drivers I'd understand if this wasn't something you wanted to do - in which case I'll wait until I can replace the card with an AMD one to use your WM. 

Last but not least - thank you for developing Hypr. I've been using it for a while and it's perfection. Looking forward to testing Hyprland as well.

862,"Not a feature request, a thanks","Thank you so much for making this. I was about to ask for it on the hypr repository as a feature request when I saw that it was already in progress. I love c++ (am learning it) and I love hypr and I will definitely use this when it is somewhat more stable. 
If/when I know enough c++ I will definitely contribute to this if it still needs it by then.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!",1
