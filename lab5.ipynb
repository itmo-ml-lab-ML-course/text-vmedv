This has been a long standing issue, though the behavior has changed several times over the last six months.\\r\\nI\\'ve been too lazy to report it but a recent commit (cbadf3e3) has made the problem significantly worse because mouse up and down events can now cause a window to lose control of the cursor by _briefly_ selecting a different window (windows only have control of the pointer when focused).\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve created four clips demonstrating the issue, two made under Hyprland, and two made under Sway. Sway seems to support the desired behavior perfectly, and I have confirmed the same behavior under KDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are all recordings of me interacting with [Looking Glass](https://looking-glass.io/), software used to interact with a VM similar to a remote desktop viewer like VNC.\\r\\nThe small dot is the local/host/Hyprland cursor position. When Capture Mode is enabled the local cursor should lock in place, when disabled it should be constantly warped to the position of the guest cursor. Looking Glass will not allow the cursor to exit the window if a mouse button is being held down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese first two clips compare Hyprland to Sway when interacting with the Windows desktop. While the incorrect behavior is slightly annoying (especially when the guest cursor reaches the edge of the window but won\\'t exit because the local cursor hasn\\'t yet, and I have no idea when or _where_ it will because it\\'s usually invisible), it\\'s still usable.\\r\\nI manage to escape the window several times. When not in Capture Mode and holding a mouse button I drag the mouse against the edge of the window, Looking Glass fails to keep the pointer within the bounds of the window so when I click the other mouse button, I manage to click on the terminal, which takes focus, breaking the capture. When in Capture Mode, the local cursor is meant to be locked, but is not under Hyprland, so I simply move it over the terminal and click, disabling Capture Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/6110140/43e49b6c-9675-44f2-8aba-d8ad2a21a415\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/6110140/a99c4c8a-90d0-41e4-a958-199c31786b6a\\r\\n\\r\\nThese next two clips compare Hyprland to Sway when playing FFXIV. Pressing and holding a mouse button \"grabs\" the screen similar to scrolling on a phone, allowing you to turn the camera. Upon releasing the mouse button the cursor is restored to the position it was at before pressing it. This mouse behavior is common in MMOs like WoW. Obviously, the mouse itself is still moving, so Looking Glass is constantly warping the local cursor back to where the guest/game cursor is being held (or is so under Sway, but not Hyprland).\\r\\nUnlike with the desktop, the behavior here is not just annoying but unusable. When playing the game the cursor constantly leaves the Looking Glass window, usually with a mouse button already being held down. When it does, and the mouse is released, or pressed, capture is broken and the cursor ends up somewhere unexpected like the middle of the Looking Glass window (it _should_ return to where the game cursor was before grabbing the screen), or in another window altogether (which then gets clicked all over).\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/6110140/7b71622f-b4f0-47fe-9c5c-7d9cf44f96a4\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/6110140/6a25da93-1012-409d-96e0-5444e874d87a\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the protocol responsible for handling all this is [pointer-constraints-unstable-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1).\\r\\n`lock_pointer` is obvious enough, and I believe `confine_pointer` is used to warp the cursor (by confining the pointer to a specific 1x1 region within the window/client, though this is a guess).\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to reproduce\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately the only application I know of to well demonstrate this issue is Looking Glass, which requires a functional Windows VM to connect to.\\r\\nIf you _are_ able to run Looking Glass, simply run it with the -M flag to enable the local/host cursor dot.\\r\\n\\r\\n### '),\n (\"Chatty / hyprland tab completion doesn't work\",\n  \"\\n\\nI use https://chatty.github.io/ alot but with hyprland the automatic tab completion window doesn't show up.

Both of the examples I can capture involve exactly one missing row of pixels, but I've also seen examples of extra pixels (most prominently in firefox with fractional scaling support).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Examples\\r\\nAlacritty (look at the row with `power_now`)\\r\\n![20240122-142952](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/22680475/0f2ac37a-107a-4679-821c-5d07b4007dea)\\r\\n\\r\\nChromium \\r\\n![20240122-143432](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/assets/22680475/460ab1f5-023e-4ce2-98e8-d06497af84c8)\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect this is related to https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/2985 in some way. \\r\\n\\r\\n### How to reproduce\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Set up fractional scaling\\r\\n2. Open an application with fractional scaling support (this seems much less reproducible on applications without wp-fractional-scale, like GTK3, but this could just be the downsampling blurring it out).\\r\\n3.

It seems to depend on which window is fullscreened in the active workspace behind the special workspace.\\n\\n### How to reproduce\\n\\nFrom my testing, it will only animate correctly if the window fullscreened on the workspace is firefox. I'm unsure if this is the only window to do it, but I couldn't find any others. I have only tested this with the dwindle layout, it may occur in others aswell.\\n\\n### \"),\n ('[XWAYLAND, Qt] Dolphin emulator issues',\n  '\\n\\nDolphin emulator, despite being a Qt application, still does not support Wayland as none of the pull requests have been merged and must be forced to run on Xwayland.

However i was not able to crash it without plugin loaded, so I have created minimal version of plugin hyprgrass, which creates hooks for this functions, but this hooks just call `m_pOriginal`, so I expect that it does nothing, but hyprland crashes onTouchUp.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n#include \"globals.hpp\"\\r\\n\\r\\n#include <algorithm>\\r\\n#include <hyprland/src/Compositor.hpp>\\r\\n#include <hyprland/src/config/ConfigManager.hpp>\\r\\n#include <hyprland/src/managers/input/InputManager.hpp>\\r\\n\\r\\ninline CFunctionHook* g_pTouchDownHook = nullptr;\\r\\ninline CFunctionHook* g_pTouchUpHook   = nullptr;\\r\\ninline CFunctionHook* g_pTouchMoveHook = nullptr;\\r\\ntypedef void (*origTouchDown)(void*, wlr_touch_down_event*);\\r\\ntypedef void (*origTouchUp)(void*, wlr_touch_up_event*);\\r\\ntypedef void (*origTouchMove)(void*, wlr_touch_motion_event*);\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid hkOnTouchDown(void* thisptr, wlr_touch_down_event* e) {\\r\\n    (*(origTouchDown)g_pTouchDownHook->m_pOriginal)(thisptr, e);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid hkOnTouchUp(void* thisptr, wlr_touch_up_event* e) {\\r\\n    (*(origTouchUp)g_pTouchUpHook->m_pOriginal)(thisptr, e);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid hkOnTouchMove(void* thisptr, wlr_touch_motion_event* e) {\\r\\n    (*(origTouchMove)g_pTouchMoveHook->m_pOriginal)(thisptr, e);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Do NOT change this function.\\r\\nAPICALL EXPORT std::string PLUGIN_API_VERSION() {\\r\\n    return HYPRLAND_API_VERSION;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nAPICALL EXPORT PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION_INFO PLUGIN_INIT(HANDLE handle) {\\r\\n    PHANDLE = handle;\\r\\n\\r\\n    g_pTouchDownHook = HyprlandAPI::createFunctionHook(\\r\\n        PHANDLE, (void*)&CInputManager::onTouchDown, (void*)&hkOnTouchDown);\\r\\n    g_pTouchUpHook = HyprlandAPI::createFunctionHook(\\r\\n        PHANDLE, (void*)&CInputManager::onTouchUp, (void*)&hkOnTouchUp);\\r\\n    g_pTouchMoveHook = HyprlandAPI::createFunctionHook(\\r\\n        PHANDLE, (void*)&CInputManager::onTouchMove, (void*)&hkOnTouchMove);\\r\\n\\r\\n    g_pTouchDownHook->hook();\\r\\n    g_pTouchUpHook->hook();\\r\\n    g_pTouchMoveHook->hook();\\r\\n\\r\\n    HyprlandAPI::reloadConfig();\\r\\n\\r\\n    return {\"hyprgrass\", \"Touchscreen gestures\", \"horriblename\", \"0.2\"};\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nAPICALL EXPORT void PLUGIN_EXIT() {\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nI added mutex to m_sTouchData and it does solve the problem:\\r\\n```\\r\\ndiff --git a/src/managers/input/InputManager.hpp b/src/managers/input/InputManager.hpp\\r\\nindex 670bc4da..66114076 100644\\r\\n--- a/src/managers/input/InputManager.hpp\\r\\n+++ b/src/managers/input/InputManager.hpp\\r\\n@@ -2,6 +2,7 @@\\r\\n \\r\\n #include \"../../defines.hpp\"\\r\\n #include <list>\\r\\n+#include <mutex>\\r\\n #include \"../../helpers/WLClasses.hpp\"\\r\\n #include \"../../Window.hpp\"\\r\\n #include \"../../helpers/Timer.hpp\"\\r\\n@@ -114,6 +115,7 @@ class CInputManager {\\r\\n     void               onPointerHoldEnd(wlr_pointer_hold_end_event*);\\r\\n \\r\\n     STouchData         m_sTouchData;\\r\\n+    std::mutex         m_sTouchDataMutex;\\r\\n \\r\\n     // for dragging floating windows\\r\\n     CWindow*       currentlyDraggedWindow = nullptr;\\r\\ndiff --git a/src/managers/input/Touch.cpp b/src/managers/input/Touch.cpp\\r\\nindex 19e29c1b..c02773cd 100644\\r\\n--- a/src/managers/input/Touch.cpp\\r\\n+++ b/src/managers/input/Touch.cpp\\r\\n@@ -1,5 +1,6 @@\\r\\n #include \"InputManager.hpp\"\\r\\n #include \"../../Compositor.hpp\"\\r\\n+#include <mutex>\\r\\n \\r\\n void CInputManager::onTouchDown(wlr_touch_down_event* e) {\\r\\n     auto       PMONITOR = g_pCompositor->getMonitorFromName(e->touch->output_name ? e->touch->output_name : \"\");\\r\\n@@ -24,6 +25,7 @@ void CInputManager::onTouchDown(wlr_touch_down_event* e) {\\r\\n \\r\\n     m_bLastInputTouch = true;\\r\\n \\r\\n+    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> l(m_sTouchDataMutex);\\r\\n     m_sTouchData.touchFocusWindow  = m_pFoundWindowToFocus;\\r\\n     m_sTouchData.touchFocusSurface = m_pFoundSurfaceToFocus;\\r\\n     m_sTouchData.touchFocusLS      = m_pFoundLSToFocus;\\r\\n@@ -52,12 +54,14 @@ void CInputManager::onTouchDown(wlr_touch_down_event* e) {\\r\\n }\\r\\n \\r\\n void CInputManager::onTouchUp(wlr_touch_up_event* e) {\\r\\n+    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> l(m_sTouchDataMutex);\\r\\n     if (m_sTouchData.touchFocusSurface) {\\r\\n         wlr_seat_touch_notify_up(g_pCompositor->m_sSeat.seat, e->time_msec, e->touch_id);\\r\\n     }\\r\\n }\\r\\n \\r\\n void CInputManager::onTouchMove(wlr_touch_motion_event* e) {\\r\\n+    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> l(m_sTouchDataMutex);\\r\\n     if (m_sTouchData.touchFocusWindow && g_pCompositor->windowValidMapped(m_sTouchData.touchFocusWindow)) {\\r\\n         const auto PMONITOR = g_pCompositor->getMonitorFromID(m_sTouchData.touchFocusWindow->m_iMonitorID);\\r\\n \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not sure what is going on, it looks like compiler does something in release build.\\r\\n\\n\\n### How to reproduce\\n\\nLoad plugin from snipped above.

As mentioned in the title, I have a dual monitor set up. Hyprland allows for swapping windows between the monitors seemlessly as you would expect. However, if one of the monitors has a window in fullscreen mode, no matter if it has other windows in that workspace or not, and I swap into that monitor\\'s workspace, Hyprland will crash.  This will attempt to swap the focused window with the fullscreen window on the other monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Expected Result\\r\\nThe window on Monitor y should swap places with the fullscreen window on Monitor x without any visual artifacts or changes to the window\\'s properties, and the system should remain stable.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Actual Result\\r\\nIt is clear that Hyprland is not secured for that use case as upon executing the `swapwindow` command, the previously fullscreen window that was swapped, loses its border and rounding, as well as is not proportioned properly. This is the sign that Hyprland will crash briefly. Some seconds later, Hyprland will completely crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should mention that prior to the crash, when it is in this \"limbo\" state where you know that a crash is coming, Hyprland does not lock up nor freeze. You can still move everything around, except for the fullscreen window that was moved. Only that window is frozen or locked-up.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional Information\\r\\n- I am not sure if attempting to move things around makes the crash occur sooner.\\r\\n- This bug occurs regardless of the direction of the swap, meaning it also happens when swapping from right to left if the conditions to cause the crash are met.\\r\\n- It does not matter how many windows exist on either workspace, as even if both workspaces only have one existing window, as long as one is in either fullscreen mode (including `fullscreen, 1` which doesn\\'t do anything really visually for the window as it is already at its maximum size, but still changes its \"mode\"/\"behaviour\") the bug will still cause the crash.\\r\\n\\r\\n## System Information\\r\\n- Linux Distribution:\\r\\n    - Arch Linux\\r\\n- Kernel:\\r\\n    - 6.4.7-arch1-1\\r\\n- Hyprland Build:\\r\\n    - `hyprland-nvidia` from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hyprland-nvidia\\r\\n    - `hyprland` from Arch `Extra` repo\\r\\n- Graphics:\\r\\n    - Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\\r\\n    - Nvidia DKMS driver (*version 535.86.05-2*) from Arch `Extra` repo\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to reproduce\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Configure Hyprland with binds to the relevant dispatchers (`fullscreen` and `swapwindow`). The following is what I use:\\r\\n    ``` \\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + CONTROL, N, fullscreen, 0 # dwindle\\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + SHIFT, N, fullscreen, 1 # dwindle\\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + SHIFT, H, swapwindow, l\\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + SHIFT, J, swapwindow, d\\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + SHIFT, K, swapwindow, u\\r\\n    bind = $mainMod + SHIFT, L, swapwindow, r\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n2. On a dual monitor setup, place a window into fullscreen mode on Monitor 1 (it does not matter if `fullscreen, 0` or `fullscreen, 1` are used as they both cause the behaviour). This window can, for example, be playing a video. For this example, Monitor 1 will be on the left.\\r\\n3. Focus on Monitor 2 on the right, specifically the window closest to Monitor 1.\\r\\n4. Execute the `swapwindow` command to the left using `$mainMod + SHIFT, H`. This attempts to swap the focused window on Monitor 2 with the fullscreen window on Monitor 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n*This also happens if the direction is reversed with Monitor 1 on the right and swapping right from Monitor 1 on the left*\\r\\n\\r\\n### '),\n ('keyboard layout error when launching and source file error',\n  \"\\n\\nI'm using Nixos 23.05 and this is a new fresh installation.\\r\\nMy nixos configuration.nix file only has normal default keyboard setting,and so does hyprland.conf.\\r\\nI can't use my keyboard and hyprland only show runtime error .So i need to push the power button to shutdown the computer and restart everytime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### How to reproduce\\n\\nUsing my config file and nixos.\\n\\n### \"),\n (\"Source file doesn't exist ++\",\n  \"\\r\\n\\r\\nerror:\\r\\n```\\r\\n source file (*) doesn't exist\\r\\n```\\r\\nNo matter how I link the file it wont work, all files are ```-rwx```\\r\\nHowever it seems to be only with my config??\\r\\nWhen I generate the default config and just source one file, for example my env.conf, it throws no error's and ```env``` shows the variables but they are not working correctly(no cursor nvidia) same with binds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf i put everything in one file i still get weird problems:\\r\\n\\r\\n1)Input wont accept empty values even though they are empty like that in the default config.\\r\\n\\r\\n2)Values for things like ```render_titles_font_size``` and ```force_zero_scaling``` cannot be set because they dont exist.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)```No such bezier``` even though its from the default config.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow  If I comment things out till I get no errors, things are obviously not working. variables are not set as I get no cursor and binds don't work either, so i have to kill from tty.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe default config works fine...\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nIt seems that hyprland will only read from the hyprland.conf it creates itself.

Every time I run a game under Wine or Proton, (might not be exclusive to Wine or Proton) after tabbing out for a while and tab back in, the mouse locking is broken. The cursor seems to be still moving. I have tested this under Sway to see if the same behaviour could be observed there and after my testing, I can say that this is exclusively Hyprland behaviour. This doesn't look like It's a Proton or Wine bug, I've tested a lot of games extensively under Sway and Hyprland and It looks like Hyprland has some problems to iron out \\r\\n\\r\\nTest games were:\\r\\nDeep Rock Galactic (Proton 7.0-6)\\r\\nOverwatch 2 (Latest Wine-GE as of 27-05-2023) (DD//MM//YEAR)\\r\\n\\r\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\r\\n>Open a game run with Proton or Wine\\r\\n>Switch to another workspace for a few minutes, maybe 10 if you want to be sure\\r\\n>Switch back to the game and have your mouse lock ruined\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected Behaviour\\r\\n>For the mouse not to lose it's mouse locking properties after \\r\\n\\r\\nNoted Outcome:\\r\\n>Mouse locking breaking after switching to a different workspace\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible related bugs on the issue tracker:\\r\\nhttps://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1732 (This issue is not the same as my mouse doesn't escape into my other monitor all the time but rather it looks like I am locked between certain regions while in-game which is caused by the mouse getting stuck on the edges of the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also worth noting that a similar thing happens on Waydroid while trying to run Roblox on it, though it might be a function on Waydroid not working, since there are issues about that open the Waydroid's Github page too.

Startup and before it crashed is still in the log.\\r\\n\\r\\n[hyprlandCrashReport1993.txt](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/11576742/hyprlandCrashReport1993.txt)\\r\\n[hyprland.log](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/files/11576743/hyprland.log)\\r\"),\n ('Partial surface used on external 4k display when the laptop screen (first listed?) has a lower resolution',\n  'ting how Hyprland works on my Gentoo Linux system. It\\'s a Lenovo P1 Gen 2 laptop with two external monitors.\\r\\nThey are physically situated as a single raw, from left to right as follows: laptop screen (1080p), a central Lenovo Thinkvision (4k) and finally, the right one — NEC (1080p).\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially, it looks like Hyprland uses 1080p as the \"base\" resolution and doesn\\'t make use of the entire 4k display surface when I set 3840x2160. If I set it to 1920x1080, it does stretch the image (though, it\\'s not the mode I\\'m want!). I\\'ve been banging my head for a while and finally tried out disabling the laptop screen. At first, it didn\\'t change anything when I edited the config and autoreload kicked in. But then, when I killed the process and started it again, it did make use of the correct resolution, with the laptop screen disabled. Interestingly, I can\\'t re-add that monitor in runtime — reenabling it in the config makes Hyprland segfault. These observations make me think that Hyprland uses the first monitor\\'s resolution as the base and doesn\\'t adjust it later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisabling the built-in monitor via settings makes the big one works properly (with the right one — 1080p — working too). It looks like there\\'s correlation with what monitor is listed first. When all monitors are enabled, their order in the `hyprctl monitors` output is as follows:\\r\\n1. Laptop screen (1080p)\\r\\n2. External 4k display\\r\\n3. External 1080p display\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the built-in display is disabled in the Hyprland config, the order is following:\\r\\n1. External 4k display\\r\\n2. External 1080p display\\r\\n\\r\\nN.B. Reenabling the laptop screen dynamically through editing the config, makes Hyprland segfault.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the first case, the laptop screen is listed first and Hyprland seems to only render the 1080p section of the 4k screen (which corresponds to the resolution of the built-in laptop display — the first entry). In the second case, the first monitor listed is the 4k one and Hyprland makes use of the entire 4k monitor surface. The second external monitor (1080p NEC) works in both cases, but I suspect this is only because its resolution is the same as (or rather not higher than) the built-in one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t have any screen recording set up bug I\\'ve made a video with my phone, to demonstrate what I mean by Hyprland using less than the entire surface of the 4k screen: https://youtu.be/kg0fBhODdto.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, I only have a few aspects of configuration, post disabling the built-in monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrepped bits of `hyprland.conf`, with the built-in laptop display is disabled:\\r\\n```conf\\r\\nmonitor=desc:Chimei Innolux Corporation 0x15E8, 1920x1080@60, auto, 1\\r\\nmonitor=desc:Chimei Innolux Corporation 0x15E8, disabled\\r\\nmonitor=desc:Lenovo Group Limited LEN S28u-10 VNA4ZZXC, 3840x2160@60, auto, 1\\r\\nmonitor=desc:Lenovo Group Limited LEN S28u-10 VNA4ZZXC, 3840x2160@60, auto, 1.5\\r\\nmonitor=desc:NEC Corporation E233WM 5Z103955NB, 1920x1080@60, auto, 1\\r\\nmonitor=,preferred,auto,auto\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n`hyprctl monitors` output, when there are two monitors:\\r\\n```console\\r\\nMonitor DP-4 (ID 1):\\r\\n\\t3840x2160@59.995998 at 0x0\\r\\n\\tdescription: Lenovo Group Limited LEN S28u-10 VNA4ZZXC (DP-4)\\r\\n\\tmake: Lenovo Group Limited\\r\\n\\tmodel: LEN S28u-10\\r\\n\\tserial: VNA4ZZXC\\r\\n\\tactive workspace: 1 (1)\\r\\n\\treserved: 0 0 0 0\\r\\n\\tscale: 1.50\\r\\n\\ttransform: 0\\r\\n\\tfocused: no\\r\\n\\tdpmsStatus: 1\\r\\n\\tvrr: 0\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitor DP-6 (ID 2):\\r\\n\\t1920x1080@60.000000 at 2560x0\\r\\n\\tdescription: NEC Corporation E233WM 5Z103955NB (DP-6)\\r\\n\\tmake: NEC Corporation\\r\\n\\tmodel: E233WM\\r\\n\\tserial: 5Z103955NB\\r\\n\\tactive workspace: 2 (2)\\r\\n\\treserved: 0 0 0 0\\r\\n\\tscale: 1.00\\r\\n\\ttransform: 0\\r\\n\\tfocused: yes\\r\\n\\tdpmsStatus: 1\\r\\n\\tvrr: 0\\r\\n``'),\n ('Killing Hyprland v0.25.0 makes it SEGFAULT',\n  \":         A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that doesn't sacrifice on its looks\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.

As the bind option would offer much more freedom (e.g. invoke additional script that updates an eww bar), it would be awesome to be able to use said option as well without having it trigger the Alt Menu on apps that support it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \"),\n ('Hyprland as a systemd user service: immediate core dump',\n  '\\n\\nI am trying to run Hyprland as a user service since I want to let systemd restart user services that depend on Hyprland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen run from command line as `systemd-cat --identifier hyprland Hyprland`, it works just fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoredump output:\\r\\n```\\r\\n                Stack trace of thread 365926:\\r\\n                #0  0x00007f936d3c4d7c __pthread_kill_implementation (libc.so.6 + 0x8cd7c)\\r\\n                #1  0x00007f936d3759c6 raise (libc.so.6 + 0x3d9c6)\\r\\n                #2  0x00007f936d35e8fa abort (libc.so.6 + 0x268fa)\\r\\n                #3  0x000000000049ef64 _Z25handleUnrecoverableSignali (.Hyprland-wrapped + 0x9ef64)\\r\\n                #4  0x00007f936d375a70 __restore_rt (libc.so.6 + 0x3da70)\\r\\n                #5  0x00007f936d3c4d7c __pthread_kill_implementation (libc.so.6 + 0x8cd7c)\\r\\n                #6  0x00007f936d3759c6 raise (libc.so.6 + 0x3d9c6)\\r\\n                #7  0x00007f936d35e8fa abort (libc.so.6 + 0x268fa)\\r\\n                #8  0x00007f936d6acc0b _ZN9__gnu_cxx27__verbose_terminate_handlerEv.cold (libstdc++.so.6 + 0xacc0b)\\r\\n                #9  0x00007f936d6bc21a _ZN10__cxxabiv111__terminateEPFvvE (libstdc++.so.6 + 0xbc21a)\\r\\n                #10 0x00007f936d6bc285 _ZSt9terminatev (libstdc++.so.6 + 0xbc285)\\r\\n                #11 0x00007f936d6bc4d7 __cxa_throw (libstdc++.so.6 + 0xbc4d7)\\r\\n                #12 0x00000000004618b1 _Z10throwErrorRKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE.cold (.Hyprl\\r\\nand-wrapped + 0x618b1)\\r\\n                #13 0x00000000004b52fd _ZN11CCompositor10initServerEv (.Hyprland-wrapped + 0xb52fd)\\r\\n                #14 0x0000000000489f0d main (.Hyprland-wrapped + 0x89f0d)\\r\\n                #15 0x00007f936d35ffce __libc_start_call_main (libc.so.6 + 0x27fce)\\r\\n                #16 0x00007f936d360089 __libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.34 (libc.so.6 + 0x28089)\\r\\n                #17 0x000000000049edc5 _start (.Hyprland-wrapped + 0x9edc5)\\r\\n                \\r\\n                Stack trace of thread 365931:\\r\\n                #0  0x00007f936d3bfc96 __futex_abstimed_wait_common (libc.so.6 + 0x87c96)\\r\\n                #1  0x00007f936d3c2488 pthread_cond_wait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 (libc.so.6 + 0x8a488)\\r\\n                #2  0x000000000058e71d _ZNSt6thread11_State_implINS_8_InvokerISt5tupleIJZN9CWatchdogC4EvEUlvE_EEEEE6_M_runEv (.Hyprland-wrapped + 0x18e71d)\\r\\n                #3  0x00007f936d6e8683 execute_native_thread_routine (libstdc++.so.6 + 0xe8683)\\r\\n                #4  0x00007f936d3c3084 start_thread (libc.so.6 + 0x8b084)\\r\\n                #5  0x00007f936d44560c __clone3 (libc.so.6 + 0x10d60c)\\r\\n                ELF object binary architecture: AMD x86-64\\r\\n```\\n\\n### How to reproduce\\n\\n1.
